## 職位描述

Location:100% Remote (CET +/- 1)

Reporting to:CTO

Team:Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) Squad

The Mission

Global Changer helps large enterprises measure and reduce theirScope 3 (supply chain) emissions- the most complex and impactful part of corporate decarbonization. At the core of this isCCF (Corporate Carbon Footprint): scientifically accurate, auditable carbon calculations across millions of supplier data points.

Our platform processes large volumes of transactional, supplier, and emissions data for global customers and turns them into actionable reduction insights. Technically, we’re modernizing a Ruby on Rails monolith toward a Go-based, service-oriented architecture, while building data pipelines and AI-supported workflows to scale accuracy, speed, and usability.

We’re looking for anEngineering Manager who is a hands-on product engineer- someone who enjoys building, coaching, and shaping systems that matter in the real world.

You’ll join a stable, senior IC team with clear product direction.

## Tasks

Engineering Leadership & Hands-on Work (~50%)

You lead by example and stay close to the code in our most complex areas.

- Build and evolveCCF and emission reduction featureswith a strong focus on correctness, auditability, and performance.

- Work ondata-intensive systems: ETL pipelines, transactional → analytical data flows, and real-time carbon analytics.

- Design and operateAI-assisted workflows(including self-hosted LLMs) to process large amounts of supplier and emissions data efficiently and reliably.

- Review code across Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js, keeping systems stable as complexity grows.

Team, Hiring & Coaching (~30%)

You grow and enable a small, senior team (currently ~3, scaling to 6+).

- Hire engineers with strong technical fundamentals and a product mindset.

- Coach the team through architectural change (monolith → services, data & AI-first thinking).

- Foster ownership, pragmatism, and a culture focused on solving customer problems - not just shipping tickets.

Architecture & Technical Direction (~20%)

You help shape where the platform is going.

- Partner closely with Product and the CTO to align product goals and technical decisions.

- Decide what stays in the monolith and what moves into dedicated services.

- Shape ourdata and AI architecture, balancing deterministic logic with LLM-based approaches and ensuring end-to-end data integrity.

## Requirements

Must-Have Experience

- 8+ years in software engineering, including 2+ years in a leadership or management role.

- Provenplayer-coachexperience: staying hands-on while leading a senior team.

- Experience evolving large systems (e.g. monolith to services) without breaking production.

- Strong background indata-heavy systems(ETL/ELT, OLTP ↔ OLAP, analytics workloads) and expertise working with Big Data.

- Practical experience designing and operatingAI or LLM-based systemsin production.

- Based inCET ±1 hourfor sufficient team overlap. Valid EU/EEA work authorization.

Technical Background

- Strong Ruby on Rails experience and solid proficiency in Go.

- Good understanding of PostgreSQL performance and data modeling.

- Experience with modern frontend frameworks (Vue.js 3 or similar).

- Solid foundation with containerized infrastructure (Docker/Kubernetes).

- Experience building software withhigh correctness and auditability requirements(e.g. climate, fintech, ERP).

Leadership & Collaboration

- Proven ability to hire, mentor, and grow senior engineers in an ego-less manner.

- Great reflection skills

- Comfortable working in a fully remote, asynchronous-first environment.

- Clear, structured communication in English.

## Benefits

Impact & Ownership

- Work on one of the hardest problems in climate tech:Scope 3 emissions.

- Real influence: as our first Engineering Manager, you’ll actively shape team culture, processes, and architecture.

- Close collaboration with product and leadership - low bureaucracy, high trust.

Setup & Benefits

- Competitive compensation + VSOP option

- 28 vacation days + flexible planning

- 100% remote, flexible working hours - family-friendly :)

- Annual team offsites

- Freedom to contribute to the open source community

Studies show that men apply for jobs if
they fulfill around 60% of the criteria on average. Women and other
members of marginalized groups, on the other hand, often only apply if
they meet every single criterion. So, if you think you have the
potential but don't exactly meet every point in the job description,
apply anyway. Applicants of all ages are welcome.

Are you the right person to help take our company to the next level?

Then simply apply to us now with your LinkedIn or Xing profile.

We look forward to getting to know you!
