## 職位描述

Location: Hybrid/ Cologne

We are looking for a hands-on Senior Data Scientist (m/f/d) with AI production experience responsible for designing, building, and operating the data and ML platform from scratch.

Start: ASAP | Languages: Fluent English

Make the Unseen seen! Our goal is to reinvent scouting in football and build the #1 global scouting platform for identifying and developing talent. With the help of modern AI technology, CUJU enables every young football talent to be seen – regardless of origin, gender, or social background. We create fair opportunities and transparent pathways into professional sports. Our platform connects athletes, clubs, and organizations worldwide to rethink scouting – data-driven, objective, and mobile. Together, we are shaping the next generation of global talent scouting.

🌟 Your Mission: As a founding member of CUJU’s new Data Team, you will build the data and analytics backbone of a football performance and talent diagnostics platform used by players, scouts, and clubs worldwide.

You will work with large-scale football performance data generated from smartphone video recordings, standardized drills, and AI-based movement analysis, transforming raw, noisy inputs into reliable, production-grade data products. You will design and implement systems that ingest, process, and analyze player data — enabling objective benchmarking, longitudinal player tracking, and data-driven talent identification.

Beyond performance analytics, you will also enable product and business insights, building analytics around user behavior, feature adoption, retention, and churn to inform product decisions and growth. This role is for someone who understands that football data and product analytics are built through software: robust pipelines, scalable cloud infrastructure, and well-engineered analytics — not just offline modeling.

We are looking for someone who is comfortable building, deploying, and maintaining production-grade data systems. Your work will directly power CUJU’s core use cases across player evaluation, development insights, talent discovery, and product optimization.

## Tasks

What You’ll Work On:

End-to-End Data Systems:

- Design, build, and maintain robust data ingestion pipelines for large-scale player and performance data

- Implement clean, versioned, and well-tested data flows from raw data → analytics → production systems

- Own data quality, monitoring, and reliability in production

Software Engineering & Cloud:

- Write clean, maintainable, and well-structured Python code following software engineering best practices

- Build and deploy data services and jobs on AWS (e.g. S3, Lambda, ECS/EKS, Glue, Athena, Redshift, etc.)

- Optimize pipelines for scalability, cost efficiency, and performance

Predictive Analytics: Develop robust predictive models using machine learning, statistical analysis, and advanced analytics techniques to forecast performance, injury risks, and talent potential

Data Product Development:Collaborate closely with Product, AI, and Engineering teams to translate analytical insights into innovative, data-driven product features and offerings

Strategic Influence: Drive data-driven decision-making across product development, business strategy, and operational improvements

## Requirements

🧠 What You Bring:

- 7+ years of professional experience in data-heavy roles (data science, data engineering, ML engineering, or similar)

- Strong programming skills in Python (clean architecture, testing, modular design — not just scripts)

- Solid SQL skills and experience designing analytical schemas

- Hands-on experience building production data pipelines and services

- Strong experience with AWS and cloud-native data architectures

- Familiarity with infrastructure concepts (CI/CD, monitoring, logging, deployments)

- Experience applying statistical methods and ML in real products

- Comfortable working with imperfect, real-world data and evolving requirements

- Focus on business and product impact, not just model performance

- Understanding that data work is software engineering

- Proven ability to translate complex data insights into clear, impactful business recommendations

- Excellent communication skills in English, with the ability to effectively collaborate with cross-functional and international teams

- Passionate about sports, performance analytics, and leveraging data to make a real-world impact

## Benefits

- Opportunity to be the founding member of a strategic new Data team

- Significant influence on CUJU’s growth, product strategy, and industry-leading innovation

- Diverse benefits – e.g. 30-day vacation, competitive compensation, corporate benefits and more

- Work at the intersection of sports and technology – with international clubs, partners, athletes, or influencers

- Creative freedom & responsibility – actively shape processes, contribute your ideas, and make a real impact

- Short decision-making paths – direct communication, quick decisions, and close collaboration with management

- Personal development – individual learning opportunities and room to grow beyond yourself

- Diverse benefits – e.g. 30-day vacation, competitive compensation, corporate benefits, and moree environment,

- Purpose & impact – build something together that transforms the world of sports

🎯 Your Impact:

- Build the technical foundation of CUJU’s data platform

- Enable scalable, reliable, and production-ready analytics across the company

- Shape how data is ingested, processed, and used in products from day one

- Directly influence player insights, product features, and long-term data strategy
