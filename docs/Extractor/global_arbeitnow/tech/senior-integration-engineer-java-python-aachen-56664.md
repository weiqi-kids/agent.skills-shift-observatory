## 職位描述

Become a Part of ACCURIDS

At ACCURIDS, we're building the data foundation for the future of pharma. Join our team of passionate experts to create the connected data networks that enable faster research, safer products, and better patient outcomes.

## Tasks

How you'll make an impact:

As a (Senior) Integration Engineer (f/m/d) at ACCURIDS, you bridge the gap between software development and practical application. You will transition from internal product development to a role where you design and implement technical solutions directly for our customers. You remain hands-on in the code while taking over the technical responsibility for client projects.

- Technical Solution Design:You translate customer requirements into clear technical concepts and architectures, ensuring our platform integrates effectively into their existing IT environments.

- Proof of Concepts (PoC):You develop and deploy functional prototypes to demonstrate how our platform solves specific technical challenges for our clients.

- Custom Extensions (Java/Spring Boot):You build and maintain custom backend extensions to adapt our platform to individual customer workflows.

- Integration & Middleware (Python):You develop integration scripts and middleware, primarily in Python, to connect ACCURIDS with external tools and data sources via REST APIs.

- Technical Collaboration:You lead technical discussions with client-side experts (SMEs) to define requirements and clarify technical feasibility.

- Advanced Problem Solving:You act as a technical lead for complex issues, using log analysis and debugging to find reliable, pragmatic solutions.

- Core Product Contribution:You implement features and improvements in the core ACCURIDS codebase alongside your client project work.

- Documentation:You create the necessary technical documentation, diagrams, and integration guides for the solutions you implement.

## Requirements

What helps you succeed:

- Professional Development Background:3–5 years of experience in a professional software engineering environment, with proficiency in Java (Spring Boot) and Python.

- Data & Backend Expertise:A solid understanding of relational databases (PostgreSQL) and how to handle data-heavy applications.

- Analytical Approach:The ability to break down complex business needs into a functional technical architecture.

- Communication Skills:You are comfortable explaining technical details to other developers as well as project stakeholders.

- Interest in Life Sciences:You are motivated to apply your skills within the Life Science domain. Experience in other regulated industries (e.g., Healthcare or FinTech) is a plus.

- Technical Versatility:Familiarity with Cloud platforms (AWS), Elasticsearch, or Knowledge Graphs (SPARQL) is beneficial but not a requirement.

## Benefits

Why you'll love working here:

- Flexible work model: Choose the setup that suits you best – on-site or enjoy the flexibility to work from home

- 30 days of paid vacation for a healthy work-life balance.

- Competitive salary package aligned with your experience and impact.

- Personal growth and development: Access a flexible budget for training, conferences, or other learning opportunities that support your individual development goals.

- Choose your perk: Enjoy either a subsidized Urban Sports Club membership or a City Plus Card with a €50 monthly allowance.

- Empowerment and ownership: Take responsibility and shape your role as we grow together.

- Modern work setup: Select your preferred system and hardware – Windows, Linux, or Mac.

- Collaborative culture: Be part of a dynamic, start-up-like environment that values flexibility, trust, and innovation.

Not ticking every box? We encourage you to apply anyway! We know great talent doesn’t always follow a checklist and we care more about your potential, curiosity, and motivation to learn.

At ACCURIDS, we’re committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. We especially encourage women and people from underrepresented backgrounds in tech, science, and data to apply.
