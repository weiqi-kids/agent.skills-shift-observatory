Key Responsibilities:

- Take ownership of reliability, observability and performance of our backend systems, spanning Rust microservices, containerised deployments on Kubernetes/K8s and production in healthcare-critical environments.

- Design, implement and evolve SRE practices: Define service-level indicators (SLIs), service-level objectives (SLOs), error budgets, conduct blameless post-mortems, capacity planning and develop disaster-recovery strategies.

- Build and maintain our infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, configuration management, and simplify deployment workflows to support rapid, safe product iteration.

- Collaborate closely with development teams to embed reliability and operational thinking early in the development lifecycle.

- Work cross-functionally to drive technical standards, share best practices, and mentor engineers on operational maturity.

- Participate in incident response and root-cause investigations. Drive improvements based on findings.

- Contribute to the architecture and roadmap of our platform: propose and evaluate new technologies/services, help evolve our Kubernetes footprint and cloud strategy to meet healthcare-grade compliance and scalability demands.

Requirements:

- Excellent German and English communication skills, both written and spoken.

- Good understanding of modern software architecture, APIs, and system integrations.

- 5+ years of experience in SRE/DevOps or infrastructure engineering at scale (preferably with SaaS or B2B products in regulated industries).

- Strong hands-on experience with Kubernetes, container orchestration, service meshes (e.g., Istio) and microservice architecture.

- Strong hands-on experience with observability tools and practices: metrics, logging, tracing, and alerting (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo).

- Proficiency in infrastructure as code, GitOps practices, and CI/CD pipelines.

- Experience with incident management, on-call rotations, and conducting post-mortems to drive continuous improvement.

- Understanding of reliability engineering principles: SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, availability modelling, capacity planning.

Nice-to-haves:

- Familiarity with cloud environments, networking, security, compliance in regulated spaces is a strong plus.

- Self-starter mindset, with an ability to influence and uplift engineering culture in a fast-growing startup context.

- Experience with Rust backends, multi-tenant architectures, Kubernetes operators or service-meshes in regulated production.
