For personal interaction, your team meets at least 20 days per quarter in the office, as our team days are held in person.

- 10% day: We want you to grow! That's why you get a day within our 14-day sprints for yourself so you can work on your professional development, your own projects, or sharpen your skills.

- Individual work environment:
Design your ergonomic workspace just the way you like it – with height-adjustable desks and the laptop of your choice (MacBook or ThinkPad). If things get a bit noisy in the office, your Bose noise-cancelling headphones ensure uninterrupted focus. If needed, we can also provide you with an ergonomic chair or additional monitors for your home office.

- Company discounts:
As a momoxian, you can look forward to a monthly voucher for our momox Fashion online shop, as well as medimops. Additionally, you benefit from numerous company discounts from our partners.

Come in later, leave earlier, or simply take an additional half day off to have your entire birthday free – provided your birthday falls on a regular working day.

Having fun at work and celebrating our successes together are core to our values. That’s why we regularly come together at various events to connect, get to know each other better, and strengthen our team spirit.

- Open work environment:
We work together in a bright, open-plan office where even the few existing doors are always open. Our teams are motivated and open to new ideas. Bring your creativity to the table and make things happen! If you need a moment of peace, you can retreat to a cozy corner of the medimops library in the break room, or recharge with a game of foosball, table tennis, or PlayStation.
