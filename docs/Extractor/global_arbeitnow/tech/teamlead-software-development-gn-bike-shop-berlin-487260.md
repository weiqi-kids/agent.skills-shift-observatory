## 職位描述

## Your mission

Bike2future is the pre-owned bike business of the Bikeleasing Group. As a 100% subsidiary, we combine sustainable mobility with a fast‑growing e‑commerce environment. We sell our bikes both in-store and through our online shop – and you will actively shape the technical foundation for this. In this role, you will take technical ownership of our new Shopware‑based B2C shop, build your own development team, and ensure that we can scale our digital business model. You can expect start-up vibes within a strong corporate group, real ownership, and an exciting greenfield technical setup. Sounds like your next step? Then we’re excited to meet you.

## Your responsibilities

- You take technical ownership of our Shopware‑based online shop – including architecture, plugins, interfaces, and performance

- Together with your team, you drive the continuous development of the shop, keeping budget, timelines, and quality under control

- You independently establish and optimize development standards such as code reviews, automated tests, CI/CD, and deployments

- You provide technical leadership for a small developer team, grow it further, and support the team through coaching, knowledge sharing, and clear technical guidelines

- You translate requirements from e‑commerce, marketing, and product management into technical concepts and a well‑prioritized backlog

## Your profile

- You bring several years of experience in web and e‑commerce development with PHP, ideally in a Shopware 6 environment

- Object‑oriented PHP development, databases such as MySQL/MariaDB, and REST/SOAP interfaces are part of your standard toolkit

- Ideally, you have leadership experience as a Lead Developer, Tech Lead, or Team Lead and enjoy taking responsibility for architectural decisions

- You are familiar with agile methods like Scrum or Kanban from daily practice and actively promote modern development processes

- Clear communication with both technical and non‑technical stakeholders comes naturally to you and is one of your strengths

## Why us?

- You’ll be part of our growth story, with plenty of room to drive initiatives, shape the future, and build a strong long‑term career path with us

- A modern e‑commerce tech environment: PHP, Shopware 6, Symfony, MySQL/MariaDB, REST APIs, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and logging

- Modern hosting and cloud setups (e.g., AWS or Azure) are part of your daily work.

- High‑quality technical equipment, with the freedom to choose your operating system (Windows or macOS)

- Back to the office? Not with us! Instead, you can expect maximum flexibility – supported by our flexible working hours model and our workation policy

- We live real collaboration: open communication, honest feedback, and teamwork on equal footing.

- Through Probonio, you receive a monthly €50 voucher of your choice, plus an additional €60 for your birthday each year

- Strong company pension benefits along with additional capital‑forming payments.

- Not currently living in Germany or Austria but open to relocating? We’re happy to support you with our relocation package

- And of course, you can lease up to two bicycles or e‑bikes through us as your employer
