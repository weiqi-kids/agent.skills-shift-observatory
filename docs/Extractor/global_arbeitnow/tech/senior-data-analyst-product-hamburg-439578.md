## 職位描述

## Your mission

You will become the team’s compass for understanding how users move, think, and behave across the product. When decisions feel unclear or messy, you bring structure. When signals conflict, you investigate until the story becomes clear. You help product teams act with confidence by turning open questions into measurable opportunities. Your work guides what we build, how we improve, and where we focus next.

What You Will Do

- Explore user behaviour to uncover motivations, friction, and opportunities for product improvements.

- Turn vague product questions into experiments, meaningful metrics, and clear hypotheses.

- Build insights that simplify complexity and highlight what truly matters.

- Partner with product managers and designers to bring clarity to ambiguous problems and support decisions with evidence.

- Identify gaps in tracking early and help improve the quality of product instrumentation.

- Create dashboards that allow teams to monitor user behaviour without repeated analysis requests.

- Share your thinking openly, from quick prototypes to final recommendations, to help the entire team learn faster.

- Revisit earlier conclusions as new data becomes available and ensure our decisions stay aligned with actual user behaviour.

Beyond your operational responsibilities, you will also embody and champion our core values every day:

- Elevate Together– Collaboration is our strength. We support each other, embrace diversity, and grow as a team.

- Xray Transparency– Open communication builds trust and strong relationships. We value honesty, inclusion, and accountability.

- Master Feedback– We challenge and support each other through honest, caring feedback.

- Own the Outcome– We take ownership, move fast, and turn ideas into results.

- Xcute Smart– Keep it simple, act pragmatically, and focus on what truly matters.

## Your profile

- Experience: 5+ years in product, user, or behavioural analytics with a track record of shaping product decisions through data.

- Product and User Understanding: Deep familiarity with user journeys, funnels, activation, retention, segmentation, and behaviour analysis. Comfortable shaping hypotheses from incomplete information and refining them through data.

- Analytical Skills: Strong problem framing, ability to move from open questions to measurable hypotheses, and confidence in designing and evaluating A/B tests. Skilled at isolating drivers of user behaviour and identifying impactful opportunities.

- Technical Proficiency: Advanced SQL and experience with Python for analysis and automation. Comfortable working with event data, experimentation frameworks, and modern BI tools. Able to produce clean, reusable code and maintain a high standard of data quality.

- Communication and Collaboration: Able to translate complex behavioural insights into clear, actionable recommendations. Strong written communication and a structured approach to storytelling.

- Work Approach: Thrives in environments with shifting priorities and ambiguous requirements. Proactive in identifying gaps, raising questions, and driving clarity. Curious, adaptable, and motivated by measurable improvements in user experience and product outcomes.

## Why us?

- Ambitious people, real ownership. You’ll work with driven, entrepreneurial people who care deeply about what they deliver, challenge each other openly, and own outcomes together.

- We’re playing at the top, but we’re not done. Our apps rank in the top 5 of their categories. We’re determined to push further, compete harder, and earn the number one spot.

- You own your own growth. Growth doesn’t happen by accident. At exmox, learning is built into the work - through responsibility, feedback, and real challenges.

- Perks that help you focus on what matters. Transport subsidy, learning budget, wellness and gym, workation, bi-weekly team lunches, and more. The perks are great - but the real reason people join and stay is the challenge, the people, and the drive to win together.

Please note: this is not a remote only position, we offer you a flexible hybrid model here in Hamburg, Germany - working from home on Mondays & Fridays, coming to the office on Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday! :)
