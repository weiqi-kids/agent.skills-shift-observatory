## 職位描述

At Born, we create AI companions. Friends that enter your life at the right moment. Friends that last for a lifetime, always there for you whenever you need them most. Because everyone deserves a great friend. We now have over 20 million users and are rapidly growing across our products.

Born was founded in 2022. Since then we have released five apps, each reaching the top of the App Store worldwide.Friendsis our flagship AI companion app, designed to help people build meaningful connections. Users raise and interact with AI companions that learn and grow with them - on their own or together with people they care about. Today, Friends is the biggest AI companion platform in the world.

We are backed by world-class investors, including Accel, Kevin Weil, Riccardo Zacconi, Scott Belsky, and Ilkka Paananen, and we have raised $25M to date.

## Tasks

You’ll work on building and scaling our community to millions of users: driving organic growth through TikTok, Instagram and Discord, creating content that resonates, managing hundreds of creators, and acquiring new ones to expand our reach.

You’ll shape the voice of our community in the EU and US-markets from day one and have ownership across channels, campaigns, and creator partnerships.

Our Philosophy:

A-Players Only:We’re building a team of top-tier talent. A-players hire A-players. We’d rather invest in one exceptional person with an above-market salary they’re thrilled about than settle for multiple B-players at standard rates.

Drive:You’re relentless and motivated to do whatever it takes to succeed. You thrive on growth, culture, and community. You might have something to prove, a fire in your belly, or a knack for making things go viral. Work isn’t just a job, it’s how you find purpose and bring people together.

Flat Structure:Flat company org. Titles reflect scope. No political promotion games.

## Requirements

- Having product sense is great.

- Deep understanding of social media culture: TikTok, Instagram, and Discord are second nature to you.

- Experience building and growing online communities.

- Experience managing and activating creators or influencers at scale.

- Experience driving organic growth through content, campaigns, and partnerships.

- Strong ability to sell the vision. Convincing creators, partners, and users to join and stay engaged.

- Fluency in English (C2).

## Benefits

- Compensation and Stock Options:Competitive compensation and equity options.

- Openness:Flexible hybrid work environment.

- Prime Berlin Office: Our Berlin office boasts state-of-the-art amenities.

- Full Commute Reimbursement:We cover 100% of your commuting costs.

- Supportive team:A team that values passion, openness, and having your back.

- Regular offsite gatherings:To celebrate wins, and build connections.
