# Senior Content Marketing Manager (English Speaking) (m/f/d)

## 職位資訊

- **公司**: Ninox Software GmbH
- **地點**: Berlin
- **遠端選項**: 否
- **發布時間**: 2026-01-30
- **職位網址**: https://www.arbeitnow.com/jobs/companies/ninox-software-gmbh/senior-content-marketing-manager-english-speaking-berlin-373488

## 職位描述

Ninox is a low-code platform trusted by more than 6,000 customers to make everyday work easier. With Ninox, teams build custom software for processes where there is no ready-made solution on the market. Together with our highly motivated partners, we have even created industry-specific tools, like a tailored solution for the photovoltaic sector.

And we believe low-code can do even more. That’s why we are currently building the next generation of Ninox, bringing AI and low-code much closer together. It’s an exciting phase and it comes with a big need for strong content.

## Tasks

What you’ll do here

This is where you come in. As part of our Marketing team, you’ll join a small content crew of three. Together, we create content that speaks to developers and business owners, from sharp thought leadership to high-performing campaigns.

But we’re not looking for someone who only “writes content”. We’re looking for a content engineer: someone who combines the craft of content marketing with the power of AI. You’ll use modern AI tools to scale ideation, speed up production, and improve quality, while still keeping a strong editorial standard and a clear point of view.

With a new product in the making, there’s always something to test, improve, and launch. You’ll create content that drives demand, supports an educational B2B sales motion, and helps define how Ninox shows up in the market, consistently and at scale.

What you’ll create

- Create content across formats and channels, from landing pages, blog articles, and FAQs to ads, email campaigns, sales enablement assets, PR copy, and event materials

- Build content that drives demand generation, from first-touch awareness to product education and conversion

- Develop lifecycle campaigns that move people forward, including newsletters, nurture sequences, and drip flows

- Create messaging that turns complex product features into clear, benefit-led stories for developers and business owners

- Bring our voice to life in the community, especially in Discord, with posts, polls, and engagement formats

- Own an AI-supported content workflow by using modern AI tools to scale ideation, speed up production, and improve quality

- Help shape an AI content strategy for the team, including best practices, templates, and experiments that raise our output over time

- Review performance and iterate with the Content Lead, using KPIs and learnings to focus on what truly works

- Collaborate closely with Product and other teams to bring new features to market with clear narratives and crisp positioning

- Bring new ideas for channels, formats, and storytelling and help us stay ahead of what’s next

## Requirements

What makes you a great fit

- A Bachelor’s degree in Marketing, Communications, Journalism, or a related field, or equivalent experience

- Several years of experience in content marketing or as a Content Writer, ideally in B2B SaaS or software marketing

- Strong editorial judgment and the ability to translate complex topics into clear, approachable language

- Excellent English skills (English-first content) and additional languages are a plus

- A sharp eye for writing quality, structure, grammar, and consistency across channels

- Confidence using AI tools in your day-to-day work, plus curiosity to test and improve workflows continuously

- A structured, self-organized working style, paired with strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset

## Benefits

What’s in it for you

We’re growing fast and you can truly make an impact here. At Ninox, we don’t do things just because “that’s how it’s always been.” You’ll work with inspiring leaders who actively support your growth.

- 30 days of vacation plus Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve off

- A beautiful office right next to Museum Island in Berlin Mitte

- Flexible work (mobile office policy), with a team that also enjoys meeting in the office

- Choose your preferred setup: Apple or Windows

- The option to work remotely from abroad for a limited time

- Access to Wellhub, including free fitness and swimming options across Germany

- Employer contribution to your occupational pension plan

- We cover most of your Deutschlandticket
