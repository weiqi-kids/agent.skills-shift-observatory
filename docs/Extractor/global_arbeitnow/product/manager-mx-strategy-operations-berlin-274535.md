## 職位描述

## About Wolt

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we're building the delivery of (almost) everything and you'll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn't always easy, but it's definitely exciting. Here you'll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You'll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you're a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

## About the Global Merchant Team

Wolt's Global Merchant team is responsible for ensuring we offer a best-in-class selection of restaurants and stores, while building products and services that help our merchants grow profitably on the platform. We work closely with local commercial teams across +30 countries and focus on driving merchant strategy, improving operations, enabling sales, optimizing the merchant experience, and supporting global partnerships—all to strengthen our overall merchant ecosystem. This role plays a key part in supporting those efforts through the launch and scale of a new in-store product for our merchants.

## About the Role

We are looking for an operator with a strong bias to action who is excited to solve problems and improve our business. The ideal candidate can flex between scrappy executing, data analysis, executive communication and cross-functional management. You'll join the Merchant Strategy & Operations team, where we're focused on building the best merchant selection for our customers.

As the  Manager of Selection Strategy & Operations you'll be responsible for developing our merchant strategy–assessing which merchants we should target, leveraging data to surface key insights, measuring performance and developing a better merchant experience. You will report to the Director of Merchant Strategy & Operations and lead cross-functional collaboration between Wolt operations, sales, marketing, product, finance to hit selection goals across 25 countries. This role will be located in Berlin or Helsinki.

Merchant selection is key to Wolt's growth, and getting more merchant partners is a top priority. In this role, you will refine our selection intelligence model to ensure we are targeting the most incremental merchants and work closely with sales and product to make sure merchants are successful on our platform–ensuring Wolt has the strongest merchant selection.

## What you will be doing

- Help shape and define our Merchant selection strategy for the organization; How many Merchants should we have on our platform? Which type of merchants? Where do we see the biggest gap in selection?

- Define and plan our overall Merchant goals, how we measure and track performance, lead with data, follow up on initiative success

- Identify selection gaps and track key metrics that are an indicator of strong selection quality in our markets

- Work with central analytics team to build and rollout tooling and frameworks for driving selection intelligence in the markets

- Work cross functionally with Sales Ops, Local leadership to surface and tackle the biggest challenges in driving selection growth

- Partner with our local countries to ensure successful planning and implementation of local Mx strategies

## Our humble expectations

- You want to affect change every day, are result-oriented and can operate in fast-paced environments

- You do not shy away from getting your hands dirty, building and testing - you are comfortable in a place where the playbooks are still to be defined and built

- You enjoy solving problems, you are comfortable with data and have solid analytical skills (SQL a plus)

- You have experience using CRM systems (Pipedrive & Salesforce a plus) and working with technical teams

- You have an ability to build cross-functional partnerships at all levels across technical and non-technical teams to achieve common goals

- You have 6+ years work experience in consulting, investment banking, operations, technology, startups, or related experiences. A combination of 2 or more of these experiences is a plus

- You communicate clearly and concisely in written and verbal comms

## Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion

We're committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That's why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.
