# Product Manager (B2B SaaS, Hotel Tech)

## 職位資訊

- **公司**: Smart Host GmbH
- **地點**: Berlin
- **遠端選項**: 否
- **發布時間**: 2026-01-31
- **職位網址**: https://www.arbeitnow.com/jobs/companies/smart-host-gmbh/product-manager-b2b-saas-hotel-tech-berlin-441389

## 職位描述

Smart Host is a B2B SaaS company in the hospitality space, building a platform that helps hotels understand and engage their guests better.

Why this role exists

Smart Host is entering a new phase, with the product direction for 2026 currently being shaped. We’re looking for additional product leadership capacity to help define and execute what comes next.

This is not a “plug into an existing roadmap” role. You’ll work at the intersection of product quality and business impact, making trade-offs between speed, learning, and long-term value.

You’ll report to Antoine, our CPO, and work closely with product, engineering, design, onboarding, and revenue teams to take ownership of a meaningful product area once direction is clarified.

## Tasks

What you’ll do

- Own a product problem space end-to-end: discovery, framing, prioritization, delivery

- Define, track, and own clear product usage and customer experience KPIs for your product area (e.g. activation, adoption, retention, and feature usage), and use them to guide prioritization and trade-offs

- Turn unclear problems into clear product bets and decisions

- Apply structured problem-solving frameworks (e.g. Jobs To Be Done) to guide discovery and prioritization

- Navigate complex product initiatives involving third-party APIs, integrations, and external partners

- Collaborate closely with engineering and design on solution shaping

- Work with onboarding, sales, and customer-facing teams to understand real customer needs, especially in the DACH region

- Use qualitative insights and quantitative data to make data-informed product decisions

- Improve product foundations and ways of working, not just ship features

- Contribute positively to team culture through collaboration, ownership, and reliability

## Requirements

What we’re looking for

- 4–7 years of experience as a Product Manager (B2B SaaS)

- Fluent German(mandatory) to work directly with customers in the DACH region

- Fluent English(company working language)

- Apragmatic product mindset: focused on impact, outcomes, and learning, not process for process’ sake

- Strong discovery and problem-framing skills, with hands-on experience using frameworks like Jobs To Be Done

- A passion for building outstanding, high-quality product experiences, with particular attention to onboarding users (to an interface, a new feature, or a new workflow)

- Proven ability to navigate complex projects involving integrations, APIs, and multiple internal and external stakeholders

- An understanding that AI is changing how product teams work, and a curiosity for how it can unlock new value in data-rich products, particularly around guest data, insights, and personalization

- Comfortable working without a fully defined roadmap and able to help shape direction

- Able to balance strategic thinking with hands-on execution

- Excellent communication and organizational skills

Nice to have (not required)

- Experience in hotel tech, hospitality, CRM, or adjacent industries

- Experience working in scaling or evolving product organizations

What you can achieve in this role

If you do a great job in this role, you’ll help Smart Host move from shipping features tobuilding products that are clearly adopted, measurable in impact, and scalable across hotel groups.

You’ll influence how product decisions are made, how success is measured, and how quickly ideas turn into real customer value.

If that sounds like a challenge you’d enjoy, we’d be happy to start an open conversation.
