## About Wolt

At Wolt, we create technology that brings joy, simplicity and earnings to the neighborhoods of the world. In 2014 we started with delivery of restaurant food. Now we're building the delivery of (almost) everything and you'll find us in over 500 cities in 30 countries around the world. In 2022 we joined forces with DoorDash and together we keep on dreaming big and expanding across the globe.

Working at Wolt isn't always easy, but it's definitely exciting. Here you'll learn more, build more, and ship more than in most other companies. You'll be challenged a lot, but also have a lot of fun on the way. So, if you're a self-starter with drive and entrepreneurial spirit, this could be the ride of your life.

Our Mass Account Management team is at the heart of Wolt's restaurant operations in Germany, supporting a vast and growing portfolio of partners. We are now hiring a Mass Account Manager to take ownership of partner success across a high-volume portfolio — improving operational performance, reducing churn, and scaling adoption of our commercial tools.

## What you'll be doing

As a Mass Account Manager, you'll take full ownership of a large merchant portfolio and work to elevate its operational performance through strategic, scalable initiatives. You'll use data to identify improvement opportunities, reduce partner churn, and lead the rollout of key levers such as Deals, Promotions, and Ads. This role is ideal for someone who thrives in an analytical environment, enjoys solving challenges at scale, and is passionate about building processes that help both Wolt and our partners grow sustainably.

### Day-to-day in this role you'll:

- Manage the operational health and performance of a large group of restaurant partners

- Monitor and improve KPIs such as availability, active rate, rejection rate, and churn

- Design and lead initiatives that drive adoption of Promotions, Deals, and Ads

- Work with BI tools and dashboards to automate engagement and identify gaps

- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to improve tooling, communication, and outreach

- Create scalable solutions and mentor Associates on best practices

## Our humble expectations

- 3+ years in account management, operations, or growth roles

- Excellent German and English communication skills

- Strong data and process orientation

- Experience working with CRMs and BI platforms

- Proven ability to take initiative, improve systems, and work autonomously

- Bachelor's or Master's in a relevant field

## What we offer

- Key role in one of Germany's most impactful merchant-facing teams

- Ownership of scalable success strategies for thousands of partners

- Independent work in a dynamic, international team

- A fast-growing tech company with many career opportunities

- Attractive salary package

- Cool office in the heart of Cologne

- Discount on Wolt orders

- Modern work equipment

- Various soft drinks, coffee and fruits in the office

- Urban Sports Club membership subsidy

- Deutschland Ticket subsidy

- Weekly all-hands meetings and regular team events
