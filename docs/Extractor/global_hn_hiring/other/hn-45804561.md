Sitch App | Founding Product Manager | NYC-area HYBRID (2-3 days/week in NYC near Union Square) | Full-time Sitch is a new type of concierge dating app. We're using AI + Humans to ask you questions, get to know you, then help you find love. We're an AI powered concierge matchmaker for serious daters. Sitch is live in 5 cities and expanding nationally in 2026. We're philosophically opposed to the dopamine-fueled mini-game doomswiping of 'traditional' dating apps which cynically monetizes desperation. We're monetizing intent! * We're top-tier VC funded (a16z Speedrun, M13, early Snap angels) * Looking for a PM who loves building for consumers, loves relationships, is a bit unusual, and is obsessed with building unique experiences only made possible with the new era of LLMs * 2-3 days/week in person, in Manhattan near Union Square Site is at https://joinsitch.com , and feel free to send me (Chad) and Dini (co-founder) a note at hi@unusual.inc
