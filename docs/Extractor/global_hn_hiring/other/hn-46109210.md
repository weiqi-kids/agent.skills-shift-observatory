## 原始內容

Unto Labs | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE (Hybrid OK), REMOTE (US) | Full-Time Unto Labs is developing the Thru Layer-1 blockchain ( https://thru.org ) We recently announced $14.4 million in funding to make blockchains & digital assets useful for the world. Founded by Jump Crypto alumni and core contributors to the Solana protocol and the Firedancer client ( https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer ), we’re tackling fundamental scalability, performance, and usability challenges in distributed ledgers. Our runtime conforms to the RISC-V specification—moving away from domain-specific VMs, DSLs, and bespoke compiler toolchains that limit developer and institutional adoption. You can write smart contracts and programs in any LLVM compatible programming language and reason about a standard ISA in RISC-V. Components are developed in C for maximal control over performance and resource usage. We believe there is a unique window of opportunity to developer fairer, more accessible, and more global financial products on resilient public blockchains. You can check out our docs and open-source developer tooling at docs.thru.org and https://github.com/Unto-Labs/thru/ We are hiring for the following role(s): - Systems Engineer: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/unto-labs/13df6bea-b253-4c80-ae05-5...
