## 原始內容

Happy Scribe | Product Engineers (Growth & Staff) | Onsite & Hybrid (Barcelona, Spain) | Full-time Hi there, Happy Scribe founder here. We built one of the web’s most accurate multilingual transcription platforms with 0$ vc money, trusted by hundreds of thousands of users each month. Now we’re taking that same tech and expertise to a bigger frontier: turning conversations into intelligence. We’re building the layer where meetings become memory, ideas become action, and teams work with more clarity and speed. You’d be joining a team of ~20 people, close-knit and pragmatic. Some of us are scaling a mature, revenue-generating platform. Others are prototyping new products that push the limits of speech and agentic AI. We move fast but think long-term. There’s room here to own, shape, and ship real products — not pitch decks. We hire only builders and kind people :) Please apply directly to our website: https://www.happyscribe.com/careers Cheers!
