CrazyGames | https://about.crazygames.com/ | REMOTE (in Europe) | Full-time | Multiple roles With recent technologies such as WebGPU and WebAssembly, the browser is quickly becoming a powerful gaming platform. High-quality 3D graphics and near-native level performance are now possible without the need for downloads, apps, or platform-specific development. Our browser games platform is already reaching close to 50 million people per month. We are self-funded, profitable, remote-first, and fast-growing. We are currently looking for multiple people to bring our product, data, and adops to the next level. Please note that we're looking for people who can work on a European timezone and are ideally based in Europe (which includes the UK for those in doubt). * Product Manager (Game Experience): https://crazygames.recruitee.com/o/remote-product-manager-ga... * Product Manager (Monetization): https://crazygames.recruitee.com/o/remote-product-manager-mo... * Data Analyst: https://crazygames.recruitee.com/o/remote-data-analyst * Programmatic Manager: https://crazygames.recruitee.com/o/programmatic-manager
