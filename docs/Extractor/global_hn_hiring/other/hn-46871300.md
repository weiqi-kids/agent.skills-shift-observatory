We’re looking for a Senior Product Engineer to join Hipcamp and help build the core product experiences that connect people with the outdoors. This is a hands-on, end-to-end role working across the stack—shipping user-facing features, collaborating closely with product, design, and data, and iterating based on real customer behavior.

This is a challenging and rewarding role at the intersection of marketplaces, real-world impact, and modern product engineering. If you enjoy owning outcomes, working in a remote-first environment, and using thoughtful tooling (including AI) to move fast without cutting corners, we’d love to talk.
