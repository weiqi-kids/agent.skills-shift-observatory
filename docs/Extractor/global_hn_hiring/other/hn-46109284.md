## 原始內容

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but to everyone commenting here saying they’re hiring and asking people to send their CVs — please have the basic decency to send a simple acknowledgement or revert after receiving them. This has happened repeatedly over the past few months after sending dozens of emails from these threads, sometimes 10+ at a time. Not getting even a basic response feels extremely disheartening. I know it’s a tough time for everyone searching for a job, and we all understand if things are slow — but a small confirmation like “Received, we’ll check” or “Not hiring anymore” takes 5 seconds and makes a world of difference. Let’s be kinder to each other. It’s been a very hard year
