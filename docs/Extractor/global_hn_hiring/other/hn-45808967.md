## 原始內容

TensorFleet | ROS Robot Engineer | Onsite & Remote (Bangkok) | FullTime We are sick of a few companies controlling all robots. Do you have a robot vacuum running around you house? How can we trust a future when a humanoid robot is being tele controlled in our house. We are building open source software to make open firmware drones a reality. We have a VS Code Extension to make coding ROS and PX4 a breeze for beginners. We are also working on courses for building drones. Are you excited about building open source robots and do you have experience in Go, C++ (ROS) or Javascript (Vs Code extension development). Drop me an email matt@tensorfleet.net Check out our product https://tensorfleet.net
