GreenArrow Email | Remote | Full-Time https://www.greenarrowemail.com/careers/developer I'm Alex McHale, Lead Developer at GreenArrow Email. We're looking to add an additional developer to our team. The right candidate will have solid Go skills and can "hit the ground running" (so sorry for the cliché). Bonus if you're a polyglot who might have skills in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. We've put a lot of thought into our job post. Please give it a read. If you think you're a fit, there's a link at the bottom of the post with a form to fill out.
