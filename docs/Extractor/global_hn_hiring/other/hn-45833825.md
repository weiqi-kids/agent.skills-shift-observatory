## 原始內容

Kubermatic| Full-time | Product Eng & Open Source Dev | Remote Europe I am looking for Product Engineers and Open Source Developers to join the KDP and kcp teams at Kubermatic. - Open Source Software Engineer ( https://kubermatic.bamboohr.com/careers/24 ): Work directly on the upstream kcp project. Your contributions will have a direct impact on the open-source community and will help build a framework for managing multi-tenant services at scale. Kubermatic is the project’s maintainer. - Product Software Engineer ( https://kubermatic.bamboohr.com/careers/25 ): Build a platform that makes other engineers more productive. Drive features from discovery to delivery and shape architectural and product decisions. KDP is currently available as a standalone, on-premises solution. As we prepare to launch a new SaaS offering, you’ll help evolve our tech stack to meet these emerging requirements.I will post the links to both roles in the comments. Both projects tackle the same problem: managing complexity across heterogeneous IT landscapes at scale. kcp is the open source foundation—a control plane technology that works with any tech stack. We maintain it upstream and contribute to the community. KDP builds on that foundation, delivering a pragmatic platform for enterprise. Feel free to PM (wojciech.barczynski@kubermatic.com or LinkedIn) me if you would like to learn more.
