## 原始內容

Boundary (YC W23) | Software engineer (compilers) | Seattle, USA (in person) | Full-time We are building a new programming language (BAML) to build AI agents -- the "typescript" for LLMs. We are open source: https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml A big part of this language is all the tooling around visualizing non-deterministic code, visualizing code, and getting great observability (e.g. our language has type information at runtime unlike TS). We are looking for engineers with experience with Rust, programming languages, and/or compilers. Any amount of experience is fine. To apply: send an email to aaron@boundaryml.com with your resume and mention you came from HN
