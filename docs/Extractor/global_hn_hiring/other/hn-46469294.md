## 原始內容

Please don't build this. We don't need human extinction due to hijacking the evolutionary instinct to bond with other people and knowingly guiding people down an evolutionary dead end. There are so many ideas to explore and problems to solve. I would be happy to give you 5 for free, I have more problems in my business laboratory than I have time to build. I'll give you a few ideas to work on. Book office hours if youre interested: hours https://calendly.com/ryanwmartin/open-office-hours
