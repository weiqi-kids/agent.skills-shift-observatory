## 原始內容

Jurisphere.ai | Founding Head of Product | Bangalore, India | Hybrid | Full-time We’re building an enterprise AI platform for the legal industry. Bootstrapped to $1M ARR with a team of ~20, recently raised our first institutional round. We’re hiring our first Product leader to take over from the founders and own the roadmap end-to-end. This is not a wrapper; we’re building complex, multi-step AI workflows, document reasoning systems, and audit-heavy enterprise software for top-tier law firms and corporates. Profile: • 6–10+ years. We care more about output density than titles. • Background in B2B SaaS / DevTools / workflow or platform products. • Has owned large product areas or whole products end-to-end. • Technical enough to discuss things like RAG evaluation and LLM latency. • High-agency: you’ll decide what we build and what we don’t. Not a fit if: you’re a process-only / Jira-first / bigco PM. Comp: ₹40L–₹70L base + meaningful equity. Strong growth as we scale from $1M to $5M+ ARR. Apply: sumit@jurisphere.ai. Short intro + links to things you’ve built helps.
