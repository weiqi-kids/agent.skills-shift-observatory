## 原始內容
Founding Engineer Wanted | Defense Startup | Munich/Remote
Can You Solve This?
The Challenge:  An FPV drone flies at 100 km/h. You have to detect, track, and intercept it physically. No Cloud. Just on-board compute using:  
• YOLOv8 Nano on Qualcomm QRB5165  Flight controller + NPU SoC. Don't know Qualcomm yet? No problem! If you have pushed Nvidia Jetson or  Hailo-8  to their absolute limits, you have the mindset we need. 
• Autonomous guidance using Proportional Navigation, MPC, or PID/LQR control loops
If that sounds impossible, you're right. It's one of the hardest problems in counter-drone defense. FPV kamikaze drones dominate modern warfare. Existing defense solutions are incapable of countering this emerging threat.
We're Herakles – Munich-based defense startup building autonomous interceptor drones.
What we offer: Equity | Founding Engineer role | Full tech autonomy 
Your skills: Drones, Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, or Robotics 
Mission: Stop FPV kamikaze drones from killing soldiers. Building the "Iron Dome" for infantry
