## 原始內容

Microsoft Research is hiring Senior MLE's in Cambridge, MA (ONSITE). Responsibilities include the training of generative models and anything that contributes to the betterment of their capabilities -- profiling / optimizing their throughput, scaling training runs, tuning of hyperparameters / data mixes, etc. If it makes the model better, it's fair game! Depending on the project, you will likely be involved in some combination of AR model training, diffusion model training, midtraining, post-training, multimodal training, etc. As you can likely surmise, we're looking for folks who are flexible and comfortable wearing many hats. If this sounds like you and you're interested in working in a research environment, consider applying! https://apply.careers.microsoft.com/careers/job/197039355664...
