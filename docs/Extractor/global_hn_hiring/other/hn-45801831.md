## 原始內容

Cloudflare | Rust/DB engineers | SF/AUS/SEA/NYC/LON/LIS (Hybrid) | Full-time Hey HN, I'm hiring engineers for the new Cloudflare Data Platform ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-data-platform ). We do streaming ingest and processing, managed Iceberg catalogs, and a distributed query engine—all built on R2 and the Cloudflare Edge. We're making it ridiculously easy for Cloudflare customers to build data lakes. I'm looking for Rust engineers with experience or interest in databases, stream processing engines, and query engines. You'll get to work on incredibly cool tech on a huge scale. Note: we are hiring for hybrid in one of our engineering hubs (SF/AUS/SEA/NYC/LON/LIS). If you're interested, shoot me an email (in profile) with subject HN and a brief description of your background.
