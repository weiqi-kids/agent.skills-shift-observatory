## 原始內容

Kyra Health | Python/Typescript | Remote (USA) | Full Time We believe there is a significant opportunity to improve healthcare quality and cost for employers, employees, and insurance companies; regulatory changes and LLMs mean it is time to build. We think we can provide a better experience for less money, and have multiple positive impacts on society. We have the idea, the funding, and the skills and knowledge to make it happen. We're looking for a few more strong engineers to help us build it. Responsibilities - Research, plan, scope, and design solutions to difficult problems while navigating laws, regulations, and standards in money movement and healthcare. - Produce elegant and simple code that is architected and written for the long haul. - Speed up overall development efforts. - Help build a development environment and operational tooling that will be the envy of companies many times our size. Must Haves - Strong Python or TypeScript skills, or a strong background in another dynamic language. - A burning desire to get things out the door and in the hands of users. - Strong communication skills.
