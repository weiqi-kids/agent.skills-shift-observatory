## 原始內容

MiLaboratories | Bilbao, Spain | ONSITE | VISA SPONSORSHIP | RELOCATION SUPPORT We are MiLaboratories, the team behind Platforma.bio & MiXCR. We are building the "OS for Biology"—a platform that processes terabytes of genomic data to accelerate antibody discovery and drug development. We are a deep-tech research lab, not a typical SaaS. We work fully on-site in Bilbao because the complexity of our problems (high-performance computing + biological nuances) requires high-bandwidth, in-person collaboration. We are hiring for two core roles: 1. Senior Go Engineer: You will build distributed systems for high-load genomic data processing. This is not CRUD. We need someone who understands memory management, concurrency, and algorithmic efficiency at scale. 2. Bioinformatics Developer (Antibody Discovery): You will work on the scientific core, developing blocks for NGS data analysis and antibody structure prediction. You should be fluent in both code and biology. The Offer: Comp: Top-tier EU salaries (~€90k - €120k). Tax Advantage: Bizkaia has independent tax autonomy. You qualify for the "Special Impatriate Regime" (30% salary tax exemption + expense deductions). The Reality: Your effective tax rate drops to ~15-20%, yielding a significantly higher net income than London or Berlin. Stock: We grant ESOP and treat equity as a life-changing wealth vehicle, not a "nice to have." Relocation: Comprehensive "Soft Landing" package (Visa, temporary housing, school search). Location: Bilbao is a hidden gem—ocean, mountains, and high quality of life with a low cost of living. Process: No HR screening. You will talk directly to the engineering team. Email me (I am the CEO): stanp@milaboratories.com. Please mention "HN" in the subject and include your GitHub.
