## 原始內容

Hiring: MouseMux | Remote (EU-friendly) | Part-time (8-16h/week) | Community + Outreach + Content I’m the solo developer behind MouseMux (mousemux.com) - a Windows tool that enables multiple users / multiple cursors on one desktop (local + remote). It’s used in trading / multi-monitor setups, simulator & control-room (SCADA-ish) environments, classrooms, and other collaborative workflows. MouseMux is at a turning point: a wave of major new functionality is landing, especially around remote multi-user collaboration. The product is becoming significantly more capable, and I need someone who can translate that to the world - clearly and genuinely, in the niches where it shines. You’ll be the “spider in the web”: * Talk to existing customers, capture use cases, keep relationships warm * Create simple content (short screen-recorded videos, posts, case snippets) * Find look-alike companies/institutions and do human, non-spammy outreach * Coordinate with relevant creators (YouTube/bloggers) for deep-dives * Occasionally post in relevant communities (Reddit/Discord/forums) transparently and helpfully No coding required, but you should be comfortable with technical users and Windows tooling. I’m optimizing for someone autonomous who can run with outreach + content. Comp: contract, €60–€120/hour depending on fit, 8–16h/week. Start with a small paid test project. Bonus possible for meaningful outcomes (pilots/case studies/revenue growth). Email: info@mousemux.com with (1) short intro, (2) 1–2 examples of content/outreach, (3) why MouseMux.
