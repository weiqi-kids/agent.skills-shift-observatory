What You'll Own: * Design battle-tested strategies that catch issues before customers do * Build automated test suites that scale with our ambitions * Hunt down bugs across complex component interactions and configurations * Partner with dev teams to ship quality at speed * Be the voice of risk assessment when it matters most You Should Have: * Critical thinking that connects dots others miss * Deep web tech knowledge (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SSL/TLS, CDN) * Automation chops (Python, JavaScript, Bash) * Experience with test methodologies and writing bulletproof test cases * Debugging skills that turn logs into insights * Communication skills that turn complex issues into clear actions Why Join? You'll be testing cybersecurity products that defend critical infrastructure against DDoS attacks – a single bug could mean the difference between stopping an attack in If breaking unbreakable systems and ensuring bulletproof security for critical infrastructure sounds like your kind of challenge, come lead, code, and conquer with us: https://www.link11.com/en/jobs/qa-engineer-remote-first-f-m-...
