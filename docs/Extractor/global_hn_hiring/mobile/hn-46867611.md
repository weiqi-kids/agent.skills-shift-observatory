Hi there! At Veho, we don't sell software. We ship packages. Lots of them. We have all of the interesting problems that crop up when running twinned distributed systems in AWS and the real world. It's pretty great.

We're hiring staff-level folks (L4+) in NYC and Boston: Data Scientists,
Data Engineers, Mobile Engineers, and Backend Engineers (typescript).

Personally, I'm hiring a Staff Data Engineer with the depth of experience to be a technical lead and mentor for the Data Platform team, while also shipping code. You will need to understand distributed data systems both intellectually and at an instinctive, emotional level. You should have Opinions about the wild boar book. You should probably also be comfortable writing and debugging English, SQL, and Python.

If that sounds like you, I really want you to apply for the Staff Data Engineer role on our career page. Our inbound applications are reviewed by humans.

With apologies that our first interaction requires this silliness: including one of the 7-digit numbers from the "ROS Calculator" on Veho's website in the appropriate box will heavily bias me towards believing you are a human being. That's more of an advantage than it may seem! It's worth the thirty seconds. It would also speed things along if you populate the "Location" field to confirm you are aware this is an in-office role.
