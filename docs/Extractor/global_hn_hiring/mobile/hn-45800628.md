## 原始內容

Tosoo | https://tosoo.ch | Zurich (Switzerland) We are looking for a motivated Junior Generalist Software Engineer to join the Tosoo team. In this role, you will contribute across the entire technology stack; designing, developing, validating, and operating software components that power our products and infrastructure. Our stack includes a C++ embedded system, a Python-based data analysis framework, several Python and Go cloud services, and PostgreSQL databases. Strong competence in at least one of these areas is required, along with a curious, hands-on attitude and an eagerness to learn and work across the rest of the stack. At Tosoo, you’ll be part of a small, fast-paced team that values initiative, technical curiosity, and collaboration. We aim to make a meaningful difference in the world by maximizing the impact of each team member. We would love to hear from you! Please send us your CV along with a short cover letter describing (or just linking to) two projects: one that represents your most ambitious technical achievement (something challenging or complex, even if the code isn’t perfect), and another that showcases your most refined or professional work (something where code quality and craftsmanship were your focus). hiring@tosoo.ch
