Looking for junior or new-grad devs with solid fundamentals and curiosity — no need to know our stack (Clojure, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Python, k8s, WPF, Svelte, Postgres). Just bring enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Hybrid in Christchurch New Zealand (mostly WFH, a few meetups each week). 3-month initial contract, likely ongoing if it clicks.
