## 原始內容

Eleos Technologies | DNS Consulting | REMOTE (US) | Contractor We build mobile apps and supporting systems for long-haul truck drivers. We have a critical DNS registrar/hosting migration to do this year and while I did the last one (on a less-critical domain), I'd really like support from someone who has done >5 of these to help our team get it right. Good news: no DNSSEC. =) Please reach out to me at phil@eleostech.com and mention this post if this is you and you have a reference or two. It should be really easy project for the right person, but we'll compensate commensurate with the business risk.
