Charge Robotics | Multiple Roles | Full-time | Onsite | SF Bay Area Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed, Series-A startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms. Check out a video of our first system here! https://youtu.be/ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E It turns out that construction companies literally can't build solar fast enough, so what we're doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation. You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life. Come work with us if you love: * Fast-paced prototype development with software and hardware components * Making a positive climate impact through your work * Hacking on massive construction equipment!
