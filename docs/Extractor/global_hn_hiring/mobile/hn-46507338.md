Lightcraft Technology | Senior iOS Real Time Engineer | Remote (US) | https://lightcraft.pro/ Hi! I’m the co-founder of Lightcraft Technology. We’re creating a collaborative virtual production platform for the future of visual storytelling. Our team includes deep expertise in robotic systems, real time video processing, and Web frameworks – and a couple of Emmys and Oscars between us! Our award-winning Jetset iOS app is the core of our real-time connection to cine cameras and stage production. https://apps.apple.com/in/app/lightcraft-jetset/id1634621836 We’re looking for a senior iOS/real time developer to help craft the next generation of previsualization and on-set filmmaking experiences, where the stage meets the network. You’ll work closely with our small, fast-moving team on leading-edge technologies in augmented reality, rendering, and networking. This is a product where milliseconds and mathematics matter, and mutexes are a love language. Spin up your xCode profiler, put the pedal to the Metal, and send responses to eliot (at) lightcrafttech.com. Technical details: https://bit.ly/4p3yfpG
