Narraduct | Trust Officers | Remote | Full time & Part time | https://narraduct.com/jobs/trust-officer/ Basically, we're looking for 3 people to document and test access, building and maintenance for many client projects or build out systems automating that. The role name is bad, it's essentially looking for sysadmins or devops people. This division operates like a trust and on a trigger (like client death), we will continue to operate their web systems. We have legal and financial structures to do this "forever", although things are at an early stage. Send resumes to info @ our website with the subject line of "career" Note, half of compensation takes form of bonuses. As most employees are remote around the world with different regulatory environments, we can't offer traditional benefits. Base compensation is ~80.000 USD. ----- Narraduct is a commodities focused consultancy and hedge fund, building tools for mining and energy companies, primarily in Central Asia and S. America. Knowledge of accounting, chemistry, geology or industrial engineering is a huge bonus. We appreciate knowledge of multiple languages and curiosity about exotic paradigms. More than anything, we look for people who will fit in and help us create value. We can make roles for good fits! We primarily use Common Lisp, with some Go, Racket and Prolog running on Linux and BSD. Some client facing stuff may feature Tcl or Clojure. We are also looking for a graphic designer or ui/ux expert who like preweb style interfaces with prouser experiences. Even though we don't have other roles currently listed, if this sounds fun to you, do send us an email!
