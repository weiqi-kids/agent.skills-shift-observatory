Rinse provides dry cleaning and laundry delivery services to customers in twelve metropolitan areas in the US and Canada. We have sophisticated logistics optimization software, a polished consumer product, and firm business fundamentals. We're now over a decade old - this is a stable, yet consistently growing and innovating, company.

Our engineering team is distributed across the United States and internationally, and has been entirely remote for years now, but a desk can be provided in the above cities if you'd prefer.

We're open to both newly-graduated engineers or more senior engineers, provided they meet our bar. We're particularly interested in true full-stack engineers, with strong React / Typescript / CSS skills to complement comfort in a Python / Django environment. We're also seeking engineers with experience leveraging AI to automate complex operational processes.

You will join a high-caliber team where collaboration, honesty, and open communication are at the core of everything we do.
