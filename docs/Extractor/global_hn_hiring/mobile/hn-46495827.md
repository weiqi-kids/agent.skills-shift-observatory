## 原始內容

PivotHire | Freelance Software Engineers (Mobile/Web) | REMOTE (China) | Contract / Project-based | https://www.pivothire.tech/ PivotHire is building a high-trust network where quality-driven companies and skilled professionals collaborate with confidence. While there are new platforms focusing on elite recruitment or open hiring, they still sell access to people. PivotHire is different: we provide a fully managed, project-delivery service that sells guaranteed outcomes. We are continuously expanding our network of developers for long-term remote collaboration, specifically focusing on Mobile Apps and Web Applications. Engagement Model: This is a contract-based role with no base salary. Compensation is agreed upon per project. Unlike traditional freelancing platforms, we manage the client interaction and project scope, allowing you to focus on development. Current Status: We have currently paused talent recruitment globally. However, we are still actively accepting applications from candidates based in China. To Apply: Please email kevin.zhong@pivothire.tech with your portfolio and contact information.
