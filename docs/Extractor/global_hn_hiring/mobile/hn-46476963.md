## 原始內容

NobodyWho | Copenhagen, Denmark | Software Engineer, ML Engineer, DevRel | Full-time | ONSITE NobodyWho is making developer tools for running small language models in local-first applications. Our core principle is to ship the model weights along with the application, and then do efficient inference locally and offline, on any device. We run fast on Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android and iOS. The main product is an inference library that wraps llama.cpp, written in Rust. We provide bindings for Python, Godot (the game engine), and will be releasing a Flutter plugin soon. It's all licensed under EUPL 1.2. Repo here: https://github.com/nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho/ We're hiring people who are comfortable building highly cross-platform FFI applications in Rust (with C++ dependencies), and people who are deeply familiar with language models and the open standards around them, as well as fine-tuning and evaluating models. We're also looking for a technical DevRel profile. If any of that sounds relevant to you, feel free to email me: a>at<nobodywho.ooo
