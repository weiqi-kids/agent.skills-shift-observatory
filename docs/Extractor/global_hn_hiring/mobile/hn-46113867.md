## 原始內容

Source ( https://source.network )| USA/Canada: REMOTE | Full-Time | https://careers.source.network Our mission is to make it normal, not heroic, for edge AI, mobile apps, and critical software to run close to where data is born: on devices, in vehicles, in field hardware, not just in a distant GPU farm. We’re building the data and trust layer that lets developers ship systems that still behave correctly when links are flaky, latency is awful, and the cloud is optional instead of mandatory—instead of the usual “SQLite everywhere + ad-hoc sync” duct tape. We’re growing fast and are looking to fill the following positions: -Chief of Staff - https://source.network/careers/chief-of-staff -Lead Edge AI Engineer - https://source.network/careers/lead-edge-ai-engineer -Head of Developer Relations - https://source.network/careers/head-of-developer-relations-r... -Lead Technical Writer & Documentation Engineer - https://source.network/careers/lead-technical-writer--docume...
