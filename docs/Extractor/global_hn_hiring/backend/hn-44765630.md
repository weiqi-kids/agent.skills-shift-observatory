Oxidian | https://www.oxidian.com | Remote (Ireland/EU ONLY)

We make sure public money is well invested by building software for governments. We're doing to government software services what challenger banks did to banking.

Our clients are mainly governmental research institutions - we're building tools for scientists to process & visualise data, HPC data processing libraries, web apps to make people's working lives easier, and DevOps pipelines.

Currently hiring a senior python dev, a mid-level python dev, and a senior rust/c++ dev.

We do government work so the location requirement is strict. Save yourself some time and don't apply if you're outside the EU.
