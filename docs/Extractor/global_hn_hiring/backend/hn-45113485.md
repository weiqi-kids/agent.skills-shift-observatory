I'm Andrea, I'm the Group Chief Architect and I lead a team of architects and engineers at UniCredit, a pan-European commercial bank with a unique service offering in Italy, Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe. We're a global team with a strong presence in 14 countries.

I'm looking for skilled Enterprise Architects and DevOps engineers to make our strong team even stronger. Our technology landscape is a mix of heritage technologies like Mainframe and a modern, cloud-native stack including Kafka, Quarkus, React, and Apigee and many more cool technology. We're committed to a cutting-edge approach for new projects and are actively migrating a significant portion of our systems to GCP.

Our leadership team is a fantastic blend of tech-savvy digital leaders and seasoned bankers who embody a "can do" attitude, making for an exciting and dynamic work environment.

Below is a detailed description for one of the key roles we're hiring for. If you're interested or want to learn more about other opportunities, please feel free to contact me directly at YW5kcmVhLmdyYW5hdGFAdW5pY3JlZGl0LmV1
