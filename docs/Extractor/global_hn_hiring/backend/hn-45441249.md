krea.ai | Distributed Systems Eng. & Data Engineers | San Francisco (on-site), CA

I'm the cofounder & CTO of Krea (https://www.krea.ai). We are a startup in San Francisco building browser-based AI creative tools to improve the workflows of artists, designers, and professional creatives. Small team (~22); millions of active users; and raised over $83M from top Silicon Valley investment firms.

We're looking for talented engineers who want to tackle hard technical challenges with smart people while building a creative platform that big companies and startups will rely on.

The job:

- Build distributed systems to process massive (billions of files, petabytes), amounts of image, video, and 3D data, solving scaling bottlenecks as you go.

- Learn ML engineering from world-class researchers on a small tight-knit team.  You’ll contribute to foundation image, video, and world models from 0 → production, and see them used by millions.

- Play with huge Kubernetes GPU clusters; our main GPU cluster takes up an entire datacenter from our provider.

Tech stack: python, pytorch, k8s, a rotating cast of data tools (e.g.  DuckDB, massive relational DBs, PyArrow, etc.)

You should apply if you are an excellent generalist engineer with strong backend experience and an intuition for systems design. Bonus points for experience with dist. systems, k8s, and existing ML or data experience (but not required!).  Cool side projects are a green flag.
