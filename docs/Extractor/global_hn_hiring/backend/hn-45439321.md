## 原始內容

Vibrant (https://www.vibrantpractice.com) | Founding Applied AI Engineer | Full-Time | SF Bay Area (hybrid)

We're building Cursor for doctors. At Vibrant, we've picked the expensive, high-touch, data-heavy subspecialties of functional, integrative, and longevity medicine, and we've created AI agents that reduce hours of clinical work to minutes.

We're a world-class team of health tech founders, AI builders, and physicians from Meta, Stride Health, and Parsley Health. In just five months, we've built notetaking/scribing, Clinical Decision Support, and some of the integrations a clinician needs to run their practice with Vibrant as their AI Operating System.

In words of doctors using our product already in production: "I have goosebumps, this is really incredible. Very accurate." "Seeing the patient overview AI-generated summary come to life after placing a couple notes is AMAZING. I'm losing it over here"

Our stack: Typescript, React, NextJS, React Native, Expo, AI SDK, and custom AI agents, RAG, tools, and agentic workflows.

It's still early days for us – we're looking for folks who ship fast and are curious and resourceful. If that's you, shoot me an email at pedro [at] vibrantpractice.com or just book an intro with me: https://book.vimcal.com/p/pedro/hn-15-minute-chat-with-pedro
