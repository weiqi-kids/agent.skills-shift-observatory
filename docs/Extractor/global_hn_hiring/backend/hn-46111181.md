Vestwell | Senior Software Engineer | HYBRID - NYC; Austin; King of Prussia, PA | https://www.vestwell.com/careers/7510610003 | $145K - $160K base + bonus & equity I'm the hiring manager for this role. Please see the job description for details, but I'm looking for someone who is, or is able to become, proficient in backend development for a public nest.js API suite using TypeScript. We don't have any hard requirements like a CS degree or prior nest.js experience, but candidates do have to complete a TypeScript coding challenge. It's a real-world problem, no leetcode. In total, our interview process is only 3 rounds, and we move pretty quickly. We want someone who has systems design experience and good technical leadership skills. You also have to be self-motivated. We use a pull rather than push process, so work isn't assigned to people, and you have to be good at working efficiently without many hard deadlines or micromanagement. Happy to answer any questions here! If you'd like to apply, please email shane.vierra [at] vestwell [dot] com with your resume.
