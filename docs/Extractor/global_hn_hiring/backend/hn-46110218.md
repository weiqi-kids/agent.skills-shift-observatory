Metabase | https://metabase.com/ | REMOTE | Full-time | Frontend and Backend Engineers Metabase is an open source ( https://github.com/metabase/metabase ) business intelligence software that lets anyone in your company rummage around in the databases you have. It connects to a number of databases / data warehouses (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, etc). Here's a dashboard about us: https://stats.metabase.com/public/dashboard/92d6b7ea-7526-48... People rather like the product ( https://metabase.com/love ). We're a remote team full of people who care about user experience, making complicated things as simple as possible and building things. We have a deeply pragmatic engineering culture and value building things that people actually use vs whatever closes a deal or makes for a good press release. Tech stack: Clojure on the backend, Typescript and React on the frontend We've posted in several "Who is hiring" threads in the past with good success, we hired quite a few folks from these posts!
