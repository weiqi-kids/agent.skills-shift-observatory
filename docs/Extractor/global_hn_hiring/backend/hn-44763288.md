## 原始內容

Autokroma.com | C / ffmpeg / codecs / GPU / AI dev workflows | Full-time | HYBRID REMOTE ONSITE | Porto / North of Portugal
We do audio video software : video editing plugins, web panels, GPU visual effects, encoders, decoders, AI assisted development & testing. All levels are welcome but be sure to make me understand what are your current capabilities and goals. You will work close to the code, user requests, whole UX in general, I try to minimize the layers between developers, products and final users.

If any of those topics are of interest to you, and you're around Porto to meet me : send me an email, the first part of the email is "contact" and after @ the domain name. Tell me your story, what you're looking for in your life now, a previous bad work experience you'd like to avoid and a good work experience that inspires you for the future.
