Metabase | https://metabase.com/ | REMOTE | Full-time | Backend Engineers, Frontend Engineers, and Engineering Managers

Metabase is an open source (https://github.com/metabase/metabase) business intelligence software that lets anyone in your company rummage around in the databases you have. It connects to a number of databases / data warehouses (BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, etc).

Here's a dashboard that has some interesting stats about Metabase: https://stats.metabase.com/public/dashboard/92d6b7ea-7526-48...

This dashboard is built with Metabase so you can see a bit of the product as well.

People rather like the product (https://metabase.com/love). We're a remote team full of people who care about user experience, making complicated things as simple as possible and building things. We have a deeply pragmatic engineering culture and value building things that people actually use vs whatever closes a deal or makes for a good press release.  We are doing some interesting things with LLMs and figuring out how to make data explorations with LLMs reliable, inspectable and useful.

Tech stack: Clojure on the backend, Typescript and React on the frontend
