## 原始內容

Hello there!
We’re Jan & Aaron from WebUp (small agency making proper websites for local shops, cafés, mechanics, etc.).
Looking for someone to find small businesses with bad/no sites and connect them to us. Remote, commission-based, flexible hours. Not a full time job.

Your tasks:

- Find bad/missing websites (Google Maps, Yelp, etc.)

- Contact owner via email/phone

- If interested, book free intro call with us

- Send us the lead - we take it from there

Pay: €10–20 per qualified lead + 15% commission if they become a client (avg. project ~€1500).
Example: 10 leads × €15 = €150 + 2 clients × €225 = €450 → €600/mo; with more deals €1–2.5k possible.

You: Comfortable talking to owners, can assess websites, reliable. Cold outreach  - some won’t reply, some will thank you.
Only paid for results — no fixed salary.

Interested? Short intro (who/where, why you fit) → contact@webupsolutions.de.
No CVs, no degrees needed we want someone who can deliver
