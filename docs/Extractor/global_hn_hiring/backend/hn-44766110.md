We build open-source infrastructure to make pathogen sequencing data more accessible, interpretable, and equitable

We're hiring a software engineer to join the Epidemiology & Virus Evolution (EVE) Group to work at the intersection of two major efforts:

- ARTIC 2: empowering real-time, low-cost sequencing & surveillance [1]

- Pathoplexus: an award-winning open-source platform for sharing viral genomic data based on Loculus [2] - https://pathoplexus.org/

Launched in August 2025, Pathoplexus has already won recognition and awards for its approach to open, FAIR data sharing.[3][4]

Work in a small, international team in a group led by Dr Emma Hodcroft (one of Nature's "Ones to Watch in 2025" [5]) and support data infrastructure used by public health labs and researchers worldwide. This is a chance to make a real impact on global health and data equity.

About you:

- Skilled in: TypeScript, React, Kotlin, Python

- Bonus: Kubernetes, bioinformatics, data pipelines, open-source experience
