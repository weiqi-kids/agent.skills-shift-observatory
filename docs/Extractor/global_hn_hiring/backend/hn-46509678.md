Senior Python Backend Engineer | REMOTE We’re looking for Python backend engineers to work on a trustless supercluster of performance-proofed GPU-enabled sandboxed docker container runners controlled by truly decentralized algorithms (not just PAXOS or RAFT). Wow, that was a mouthful... If you found it interesting, join Reef Technologies and tackle complex technical challenges like this on your own terms: - Contribute from wherever you like—we are fully remote - Set your own time commitment, as long as it’s at least 30h per week - See how we work in our handbook: github.com/reef-technologies/handbook - Influence the way we operate through our Sociocracy 3.0 decision-making process Salary on a B2B contract: - 45-70 USD or 180-280 PLN per hour - Flexible work schedule (as measured with a time tracker) - We automatically adjust rates based on inflation twice a year We're looking for someone with 5+ years of programming experience, including at least a year with Python (including opensource and significant personal projects). So, what do you think? You don't even need a CV, just go to https://careers.reef.pl/?utm_source=hackernews and shoot a few quick commands to apply.
