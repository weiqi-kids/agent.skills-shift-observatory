Count is like Jupyter, Tableau and Miro combined in one tool. Some of the world's leading data teams use it for everything from iterating data models and performing in-depth analyses to creating process flow maps of their entire business.

We're a small team looking for experienced software engineers who are interested in tackling deep technical challenges in the data analytics space.

For the best possible user experience, we have developed various technologies in-house, including a custom WebGL rendering engine, our own data visualization library, and a reactive SQL/Python notebook and database query framework.

Example projects: leveraging agentic workflows in data exploration, accelerating rendering using quadtree tiling, extending interactivity and customizability of visualizations, developing serverless frameworks for executing database queries at high concurrency.

Our tech stack: TypeScript, Python, Node, WebAssembly, WebGL, Apache Arrow/Parquet, DuckDB, Kubernetes, React.
