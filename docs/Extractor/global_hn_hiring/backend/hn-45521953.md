Scale AI | Product Security Engineer | TypeScript, Node, Python, AWS | Full-time | Hybrid in San Francisco, CA or NYC or Remote

This is for a team that I'm working closely with and helping grow. We're hiring for somebody with a hybrid SWE and Security background to help scale up the team.

It's currently one engineer who's got a ton on his plate, so the ideal person for this role is somebody who's interested in learning, digging in deep to fix issues (especially shipping PRs), and helping shape the future roadmap of the team. It is not an analyst role.

The role is primarily targeted at mid-career folks with a few years of experience (2+ years minimum). Those that are Senior/Staff level folks, especially those with a strong SWE background that are curious about security, are encouraged to apply if this role resonates strongly. (I personally transitioned from SWE -> ProdSec, years ago, and several other folks on the broader Security team have non-Security backgrounds too.)

Here is the role: https://scale.com/careers/4602047005

Feel free to apply there, email me with you resume (on my profile), or add me on LinkedIn[0]. I'll try my best to answer questions and reply to everybody, but sometimes there is so much inbound that it isn't possible. Thanks!
