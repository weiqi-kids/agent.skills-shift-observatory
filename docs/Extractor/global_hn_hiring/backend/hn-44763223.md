Pylon (https://pylonlending.com) | ONSITE Menlo Park / San Francisco, CA

What Stripe did for payments, Pylon is doing for the mortgage industry: We're taking a sleepy industry with backward technology and re-building the stack from the ground up. We're first-principles thinkers, and our team is small, talented and ambitious.

I'm hiring generalists who love coding and want to build something beautiful in an industry where technology written in the 90s is the norm. We're Series A, well funded, and we have traction with customers. Come to Menlo Park or SF and help us turn the $2 trillion US mortgage industry into a set of APIs.
