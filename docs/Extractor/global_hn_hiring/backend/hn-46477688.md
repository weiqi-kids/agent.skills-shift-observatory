## 原始內容

Afi Labs | Sales Associate | REMOTE (US) | Contract or Full-time Afi Labs ( http://www.afi.io ) is a software consulting company that specializes in building software for transportation and logistics companies. I'm looking for a part or full-time sales associate to sell route optimization software and APIs to grocery delivery companies, tech forward logistics providers or larger fleets that would benefit from truck routing. The ideal candidate would have either worked at a route optimization provider or is deeply connected to the last mile delivery industry (e.g. you've sold software or services to third party logistics providers). Email afian at afi dot io if this sounds like you.
