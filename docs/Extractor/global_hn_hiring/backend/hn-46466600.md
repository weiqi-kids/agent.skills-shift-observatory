## 原始內容

Spacelift | Remote (Europe) | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer | $80k-$110k+ (can go higher) We're a VC-funded startup (recently raised $51M Series C) building an infrastructure orchestrator and collaborative management platform for Infrastructure-as-Code – from OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Kubernetes, to Ansible. On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack. Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://careers.spacelift.io/jobs/3006934-software-engineer-... You can find out more about the product we're building at https://spacelift.io and also see our engineering blog for a few technical blog posts of ours: https://spacelift.io/blog/engineering Additionally , we're hiring for a new product we're building, Flows. Mostly the same requirements and tech stack, without the devops bits. You can see a demo of Flows and apply for it here: https://careers.spacelift.io/jobs/6438380-product-software-e...
