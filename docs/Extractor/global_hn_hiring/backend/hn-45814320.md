Jane Street | Hybrid | Full-time If you haven't heard of us before, we’re a quantitative trading firm that cares a lot about technology. This means building elegant solutions that scale well, never assuming that “best in market” is the same as “best possible,” and ensuring everybody has the resources needed to do their jobs well. We're looking for folks in New York, London, Hong Kong, and Singapore for a variety of roles including, but not limited to: - Data Engineers who can help us understand, clean, manage and share the data that guides our trading. At Jane Street, having a thorough and accurate understanding of data is at the core of everything we do -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/6558007... - Machine Learning Engineers with robust experience in machine learning and strong mathematical foundations. Machine learning is a critical pillar of Jane Street's global business. Our ever-evolving trading environment serves as a unique, rapid-feedback platform for ML experimentation, allowing us to incorporate new ideas with relatively little friction -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/6485460... - A Machine Learning Educator who will be instrumental in maintaining and growing our ML educational programs and classes, spanning topics such as an introduction to general ML, efficient use of AI assistants, our internal stack for training models, and how to reason about performance -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/8056588... - Software Engineers who are intimately tied into every area of our business. We are big believers in functional programming, using OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language. We also believe in the value of open source software, using it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/4274288... - Frontend Software Engineers who are passionate about user-interface design and typed functional programming. You would take part in the design and implementation of our next-generation of browser-based tools for operating our trading infrastructure -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/6184529... - A Programmer-Who-Writes, or a Writer-Who-Codes -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/7604415... - Production Engineers who spend time both developing software and providing high-quality support for software systems that are critical to our trading business -- https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/position/5108180...
