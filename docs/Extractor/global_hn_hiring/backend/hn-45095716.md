Rinse | IT Manager / Network Administrator / System Administrator | Hybrid in SF Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York (Brooklyn), Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Washington DC, or Newark. (Primarily remote with some on-site responsibilities.) | Full-time | https://www.rinse.com

Rinse provides dry cleaning and laundry delivery services to customers in eleven metropolitan areas in the US. We have sophisticated logistics optimization software, a polished consumer product, and firm business fundamentals. We're now over a decade old - this is a stable, yet consistently growing and innovating, company.

Given our distributed nature, we have growing network and workstation infrastructure, and it's time to hire our first full-time leader to manage this system.  The ideal candidate can:

- Operate with autonomy and integrity across network, server, infrastructure, and desktop environments

- Communicate cross-functionally, to internal stakeholders at all levels

- Navigate our (primarily Linux) technical environment

- Spearhead projects to improve our technology's security, reliability, and functionality

- Facilitate our corporate efficiency via desktop administration

Because this role has some physical hardware responsibilities, we'd prefer it be filled by someone in the above localities, even though the vast majority of the role can be performed remotely.

We're open to both newly-graduated or more senior technically-minded individuals and managers, provided they meet our bar.

Search term bingo: Logistics, Linux, Python, Ansible, Systems Administration, Network Administration, Information Technology, Amazon Web Services, AWS, Cloudflare, Automation, Security, Systems Engineer.
