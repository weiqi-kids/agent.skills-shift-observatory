## 原始內容

At IP Fabric, we’re redefining how enterprises see their networks. Our platform uncovers the truth hidden inside complex infrastructures — automatically discovering and modeling massive network graphs in real time. We’re now looking for a Senior Backend Developer to help us shape the future of our Network Automation Engine — the brain behind our Discovery Service. You’ll build a distributed service responsible for scanning large-scale computer networks (hundreds of thousands of devices), collecting configuration and topology data, and building an accurate network graph. The service is being redesigned for parallel exploration to significantly improve performance, scalability, and data freshness, while ensuring correctness and avoiding duplicate discovery paths We’re heavy on Node.js/TypeScript, exploring Go, and thrive on clean, scalable, and resilient design. If you love distributed systems, own your code end-to-end, and want to join a team of engineers who build the tools they once wished they had — we’d love to talk.
