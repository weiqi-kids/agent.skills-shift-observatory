Trinsic | Software Engineer | REMOTE (North America) | Full‑time We’re building the first Identity Acceptance Network—the “Visa for ID.” Humanity is editing genes, starting space tourism and working on artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, identity verification is still done by taking pictures of plastic cards . We’re bringing identity into this new age, where trust is essential and becoming more so every day with AI. We enable accepting digital IDs that users already have (mDLs, BankIDs, reusable IDs) and verify users ~10x faster across 40+ networks covering 500M+ people. Role - Software Engineer (#5 on the team; ~20% of eng capacity). High ownership, product-minded, backend and systems leaning. - You’ll ship fast, prune scope, and help shape our engineering culture. - You’ve thrived in early-stage environments, can tackle fires independently, and care as much about product as code. - Strong backend experience; generalist who enjoys moving up/down the stack. - You care deeply about user privacy and data security. Stack & ways of working - .NET (C#) backend, React + TypeScript frontend, Azure, GitHub CI/CD. - Remote‑first in North America; strong async work habits; - We’re keen but responsible adopters of AI tooling to hit our high bar of excellence. Comp & benefits - Salary set by a transparent formula (we target ~60th percentile cash for our stage) + meaningful equity, usually 90th+ percentile for a startup of our stage. - Premium US healthcare (75% of premiums covered for you & dependents), at least 15 days PTO, $900/yr fitness stipend, $350/mo coworking or $200/mo home office, first week is “Think Week” to help you transition into your new role, paid family leave, top‑tier laptop, twice‑yearly in‑person offsites.
