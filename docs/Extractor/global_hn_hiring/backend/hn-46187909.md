General Catalyst-backed Stealth AI Startup | Founding Engineer | Onsite (New York City) | Full-time We’re building the AI operating system for engineering firms - automating the workflows behind the infrastructure America runs on. Founded by engineers and operators from Citadel, Amazon AI, Stanford and Columbia. The team recently raised a large Seed round and is scaling quickly. We're looking for exceptional engineers with strong backend development and systems engineering skills. Experience working with LLM-based systems at scale, building RAG pipelines, working with embeddings and vector stores, and building effective context management systems is strongly preferred. You'll work directly with me (CTO / co-founder) to define the system architecture, take ownership of key product features, and build out the platform's core AI systems. Our culture is simple: we move extremely fast, hold a high bar for exceptional talent, and pay people very well. Reach out to me at cgoggins0@gmail.com to hear more.
