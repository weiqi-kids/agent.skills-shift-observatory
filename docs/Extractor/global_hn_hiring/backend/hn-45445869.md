Avy | Staff Engineer / Startup Polyglot Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite (Hybrid) | Full-Time | https://www.avy.app

We are an early-stage, well-funded startup making humans and computers work together more efficiently. Experienced team from Apple AIML and other great companies.

We're looking for a polyglot "startup engineer" at the Staff+ level can help with the end-to-end implementation of new features and capabilities and who can move between different components, be creative, be flexible, take ownership, and get things done. We have a complex, challenging product, but one that's amazing to work on and that will soon change how people think about working with each other and with AI.

You'll enjoy this role if:

- You like going 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product

- You are innovative, get satisfaction out of learning new things, and thrive in an environment of uncertainty and opportunity

To succeed, you should:

- Have the wisdom to know when to take the fast route vs when to step back and clean up your mess

- Be capable and excel on your own, but be humble and communicate well with others as projects require more collaboration

- Be versed across many programming languages (e.g. from C++/Java/Swift to Go to JavaScript or Python)

- Have worked on many types of projects and software -- have you built servers, written games, shipped native apps, and vibe-coded (kidding) web apps? If so, you're a fit.

- Be versatile and work both high level and low level, on old tech and new. Have you both prompt-engineered an LLM AND tweaked the code that decodes tokens in your own local LLM runner? If so, you're a fit.
