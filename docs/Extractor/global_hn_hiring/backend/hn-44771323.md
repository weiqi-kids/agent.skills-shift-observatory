New Hedge fund | Sr IC Frontend Engineer | Full-time | On-site (NYC)

We are a new discretionary, tech industry focused L/S hedge fund, founded by a portfolio manager with 15+ years of experience at a well known Tiger Cub. I lead the data/technology team here and previously spent ~6 years in a similar role at that firm as well. We are not the only ones trying to figure out how to use AI in investing but in a world where there are lots of people trying to build picks & shovels, this is an opportunity to be one of the goldminers at a greenfield, new firm. This role makes sense for people who are interested in finance/investing (although you do not necessarily have to have experience in the industry).

We are hiring for a frontend IC engineer for our internal web application.

One of our core advantages is marrying domain experts (ie. experienced fundamental investors from top tier hedge funds) with tech talent. Our frontend (the design, the UX, the UI) _really_ matters to tie the two sides together. The quality of the data we can collect, the speed of testing new ideas, and there ultimately success is driven by the quality of our frontend -- as unintuitive as that might sound.

Our tech stack: * Frontend: Typescript, Vue3 * Backend: AWS, Cloudflare, Supabase/Postgresql, Typescript *

- We work very hard, hours are long, and people are very dedicated to the mission. It is not for everyone, but for those interested in competing in financial markets, love startup atmosphere without near-term existential risk, and want to work with super smart colleagues (both technical and investors!), this could be a great fit.

- We're in full-time in office in NYC, so that's a requirement for FTE. We are potentially open to exceptional contractors located remotely.

- Target salary 180-250K, depending on experience + Bonus/Carry (hedge fund equity equivalent)

If you are interested, I would love to hear from you:

- Contact: ai at nx1 dotcom , I'm Alex.
- Please include resume or LinkedIn and some example of something you have built (could be Github, could be your current company, anything really)

If you want to learn more about types of things we think about, I will shamelessly direct you to my blog where I write about the space (and did so more while I wasn't at any fund): https://magis.substack.com
