Building the next generation of trust & estate planning software

Dynasty is building a modern trust platform for startup founders and families, with a focus on QSBS trust stacking so founders can multiply the Section 1202 capital gains exclusion across beneficiaries. We make it possible to set up, fund, and maintain QSBS eligible trusts with ongoing compliance through a vertically integrated model that includes trust administration

We are based in San Francisco and work together in person.

Open Roles

- Sales

You will work directly with prospective customers, many of whom are founders, operators, and high net worth families. You will guide them through understanding our solutions, manage pipeline, and close new business. This role is ideal for someone who is consultative, comfortable discussing financial concepts, and excited to help people make important long term decisions.

- Onboarding

You will help new customers successfully set up their trusts through our platform. This includes collecting information, coordinating next steps, answering questions, and ensuring a smooth transition from signup to completed structure. This role is great for someone detail oriented who enjoys guiding people through complex processes with clarity and care.

What We Look For

    * Strong communication skills
    * Comfort working in person on a small, fast moving team
    * High ownership and follow through
    * Interest in startups, fintech, or estate planning
