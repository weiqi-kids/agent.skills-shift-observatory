## 原始內容

Hey all,

I'm one of the founding engineers at Axle (backed by Google + YC) and we're building the universal API for insurance data (think Plaid for insurance).

We've 5x'd this year and are hiring quick to keep up with demand. We're looking to bring on some more engineers onto the team. We'd love to chat if you're excited by startup life. Our team is in-person 4 days a week in our Flatiron/NoMad office in NYC.

What we're looking for
- 1+ years of experience (or equivalent) building software systems in production environments.
- Ability to take abstract projects end-to-end, operating with high agency
- Desire to learn and be scrappy when faced with uncertainty
