Read more about our latest Series A announcement in TechCrunch (https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/23/allspices-platform-is-the-...)!

We have a highly capable, tight-knit, remote-first team with a flex office in Somerville, MA and SF. We strongly value continuous communication and personal development. See more on our careers page https://allspice.io/careers

We’re hiring primarily for:

Principal/Lead Software Engineer - You'll lead our platform software team (Vue, TS, Golang, Playwright), building and improving our data architecture for git-based hardware design management. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/allspice/1dd0081e-1124-4dea-b16f-e3...

Sr./Principal Product Manager (Platform) - You'll lead our core product platform user experience, with new ECAD file integrations, collaboration features, and improved onboarding experience for git. You should have some experience in the hardware design process and git. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/allspice/4d547ef4-e8c5-47c1-861d-15...

Sr./Principal Technical Product Manager (AI) - You've been an early adopter, introducing AI features in your past products. You understand how to tame large amounts of data for use in RAG to get consistent, functional output from LLMs, and you're not afraid to talk tensors. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/allspice/a37723bf-b043-41b1-9365-e5...

Mid+ SW Parsing and datastructures (rust) - Systems programming experience required. You'll be responsible for helping develop our ECAD schema and convert between file formats efficiently. This role can flex to be pretty senior if you have more experience than is listed.

Lead/Principal Infrastructure Engineer - You are passionate about optimizing infrastructure at scale and have a strong background in security engineering, AWS, and infrastructure automation. In this role, you will be responsible for working with company leadership to build our infrastructure roadmap and team, as well as executing tasks (80/20 individual contributor work to management, with greater management opportunity available as the team grows).
