Property Meld | Mid-level and Senior Software Engineers, Product Designer, Product Manager | Full-time | Remote (US & Canada) or Rapid City, SD

Looking for something more meaningful? How about the opportunity to have a direct impact on the property maintenance experience for hundreds of thousands of residents?

Welcome to the future of property maintenance. Property Meld’s vision is to radically improve how the property management industry handles property maintenance. If you’ve ever had a maintenance issue at your housing rental, you know how much of a pain it can be to get it fixed quickly and reliably. It doesn't have to be this way. We're rethinking the entire property maintenance experience from the ground up with two things in mind - first, driving the cost of doing maintenance to the absolute minimum, and second, providing an experience to residents and property owners that makes them want to stay with their property manager. If you are excited about turning something that has historically been a negative experience (maintenance) into a positive experience, we'd love to talk with you.

Stack: Python, Django, Typescript, React, React Native, PostgreSQL
