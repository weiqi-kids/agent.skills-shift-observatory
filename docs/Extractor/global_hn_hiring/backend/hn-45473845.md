Numtide | Software Developer Contractor | Full-time | Remote

We're seeking an experienced software developer to work on novel problems in data storage on Ethereum. We're launching a new network that uses Optimism L3s.

You'll develop smart contracts, design and maintain infrastructure built for resilience, throughput and decentralization (Optimism, Kubernetes, IPFS) and manage deployment pipelines (argo-cd, restate).

Key Requirements:

  - Experience with, and interest in keeping up with, the Ethereum ecosystem
  - Knowledge of the architecture and trade-offs of optimistic rollups
  - Good understanding of Solidity for smart contract development
  - DevOps experience with CI/CD, containerization, and Kubernetes

Competitive rates, flexible schedule.
