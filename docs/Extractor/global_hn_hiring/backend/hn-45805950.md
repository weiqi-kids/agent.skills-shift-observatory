## 原始內容

Altira Health | Remote (US) | Full-time | Founding Software Engineer (Interop) | https://www.altirahealth.com/ We're building an AI care platform to reduce ER visits, close care gaps, and guide patients to the right care at the right time. We're a pre-seed healthcare startup working with major providers to drive real outcomes. We have great runway, we're moving fast, and we have lots of leads that mean we can't build fast enough. We also believe in compliance and security from day 0. We're looking for someone with deep healthcare integration experience to hit the ground running. Ideally they're a pragmatic backend expert to help us scale as we continue to grow. Integrations can be a full time role, but at a startup it's necessary to wear many hats. So this individual should also feel comfortable as a generalist who can jump in at any part of the stack. Stack: Python, Django, GraphQL, AWS, TypeScript, React, Terragrunt/OpenTofu Ideal: early-stage experience, deep experience in healthcare integrations, thrives solving problems Fair compensation + equity JD and application: https://app.dover.com/apply/altirahealth/862317ca-7c42-4dc1-...
