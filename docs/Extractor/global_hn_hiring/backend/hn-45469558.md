HomeVision | Multiple Roles - Eng, SRE | Hybrid SF & Remote | Full-Time | $100k-$220k + equity

Looking for two roles:

1. Backend Engineer & FrontEnd Engineer (Hybrid SFO)

I'm looking for junior-to-senior software engineers to work with me (CTO) directly. Our systems process millions of pages of documents a month for the mortgage industry. We work with some of the largest lenders in the country and are at the forefront of applying LLMs and other multi-modal models in this industry. New-grad and junior engineers particularly encouraged to apply. Looking for people who are motivated to write good code with a good mix of practicality and aesthetics.

2. SRE - US Remote (SFO or Seattle preferred)

This is a broad role on the platform team including AWS infra w/terraform, software engineering, and IT
