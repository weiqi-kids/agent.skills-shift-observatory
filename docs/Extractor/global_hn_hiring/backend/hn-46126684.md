## 原始內容

Candid | Founding Engineer | Cambridge/Boston | Onsite/Hybrid We're building a photo-sharing app that uses CV to automate the annoying parts of sharing photos with friends. Stack: FastAPI, Postgres, Supabase, AWS. We have a mobile app in progress and an ML pipeline—need someone to own the backend, wire it all together, and ship. Looking for someone who's: - Done real backend work (Python, FastAPI, whatever) - Deployed ML/CV to prod, not just notebooks - Knows their way around embeddings and similarity search - Cares about privacy/security (we're handling sensitive data) - Has shipped something real, ideally end-to-end This is a founding engineer role. You'd work directly with me (CEO) and our mobile engineer. High ownership, fast pace, significant equity. Bonus if you've done mobile integrations or been an early engineer before. Cambridge/Boston based. Prefer onsite but hybrid works if you can hit the ground running. nlm280@gmail.com | Subject: "Founding Engineer – Candid" Drop your GitHub and a quick note about something you've built from scratch.
