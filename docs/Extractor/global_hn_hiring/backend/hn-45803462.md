## 原始內容

Phrasing.app | Co-founder | EUROPE REMOTE Phrasing is a bootstrapped company dedicated to building the most effective and efficient way to learn a language. I’m a polyglot myself and have always struggled for a few main reasons: 1. Apps only ever focus on taking you from 0-1, never from 1-100. 2. If you have any experience in the language, it’s really hard to pick it up after a few years. 3. Language learning apps are always ugly, clunky, ugly, and just stressful to use. And ugly. 4. No apps support maintaining and learning multiple languages simultaneously 5. Apps only ever support the major languages, leaving minority languages in the dust So, I set off to build my dream language learning application, and a quick 2 years and 10,000 hours later I’d built Phrasing. It’s launched, it’s live, it has (happy) paying daily users, and I myself am using it to learn 18 languages. The product is ready to go, and the business is already growing organically. I’m looking for someone cracked to come in in a co-founding capacity and eventually take over the backend (elixir) codebase from me. No experience is required so long as you’re passionate, talented, and hungry. If you’re interested, and located in Europe, send me an email at hn@phrasing.app.
