Clerq is a NYC based fintech startup building a next generation platform payments platform that delivers a seamless checkout experience for high-ticket transactions. By leveraging modern bank rails, the platform offers the conversion and UX benefits of cards with risk and money movement infrastructure purpose-built for large purchases. Clerq replaces outdated manual payment methods like cash, checks and wires and expensive card surcharges with a smooth, integrated solution that helps merchants convert more customers without sacrificing margins.

We have started with the $1T+ U.S. auto vertical, where our platform is growing rapidly and already powering payments for several of the most recognized brands in the industry including multiple Fortune 500 companies. With proven traction, the company has expanded into high-growth adjacencies including high-ticket e-commerce, private travel and powersports.

We are a lean team and looking for senior or staff level engineers to help us accelerate our growth and build a future that doesn't rely on credit card networks.

Comp: $180-210k + Equity
