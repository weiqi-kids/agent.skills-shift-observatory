Agile Six | Remote (US) | https://agile6.com/ | Full-time A6 is hiring an Enterprise Engineering Strategist! Pay's $207,132. https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/agilesix/jobs/7518746003 Agile Six is a people-first, remote-work company that serves shoulder-to-shoulder with federal agencies to find innovative, human-centered solutions. We build better by putting people first. We are animated by our core values of Purpose, Wholeness, Trust, Self-Management and Inclusion. We deliver our solutions in autonomous teams of self-managed professionals (no managers here!) who genuinely care about each other and the work. We know that’s our company’s purpose – and that we can only achieve it by supporting a culture where people feel valued, self-managed, and love to come to work. *TL;DR*: We're a federal contractor. As an Enterprise Engineering Strategist at Agile Six, you will leverage your deep expertise in software engineering, emerging technologies, and applied AI to strengthen and evolve engineering practices across the organization. This role combines hands-on project work with enterprise-level coaching, focusing on how AI-informed tools, patterns, and approaches are redefining what it means to design, build, and deliver software. You will help Agile Six navigate this transformation – guiding teams as engineering roles, workflows, and required skills evolve – and play a pivotal role in shaping the future of engineering and applied AI practice at Agile Six. Feel free to drop me a line at strong.dot4349@tenesm.us if you'd like more information about what it's like working at A6 (it's pretty great). I can't exactly refer you if I don't know you and haven't worked with you, but I can make sure your résumé gets seen by fresh eyes.
