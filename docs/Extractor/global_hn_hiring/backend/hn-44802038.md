Boot.dev | Senior Course Producer (Full Time, Remote)

We’re building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom. We’re a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be. We are looking for a course producer and editor to help us create more programming and computer science courses on Boot.dev!

If you’re a highly technical developer with a love for teaching, this could be the perfect role for you! Your main responsibility will be to work with course authors and our in-house engineering team to produce new high-quality interactive courses on the Boot.dev learning platform. Our courses are highly engaging with coding challenges and quizzes along the way. They are mostly written (in Markdown), however, each course also typically includes 5-10 explainer videos that our in-house animators and editors help create visuals for.
