Brico | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE (Hybrid OK)| H1B Transfer OK | Full-Time | https://www.brico.ai Brico takes the hassle out of financial licensing for Financial Institutions and FinTechs. We automate new license applications, maintenance, and renewals, creating a 1-stop shop for all licensing needs. Put simply, we are creating from the ground-up dedicated AI-augmented software to manage complex regulatory compliance workflows that used to live in spreadsheets and emails, across all 50+ US jurisdictions. We've just closed our Series A! Our revenue has grown 600% since starting 2 years ago, with strong product/market fit and customers such as Marqeta, BitGo, Conduit and Bilt. We are a small but mighty backend-but-do-it-all engineering team of 4, taking on any challenge that's thrown at us in order to build for and support our growing customer base ranging from ambitious crypto startups to established Fortune 500 financial services companies. I am hiring senior/staff backend engineers who are also comfortable going up the stack when required to work on our frontend (we are all backend folks). Tech stack: python/django+drf/react Reach out to me directly (Co-Founder/CTO) at ed [-at-] brico.ai with HN in the subject line.
