We’re building an AI system for analysts and scientists, based on a fundamentally new approach to reasoning and knowledge representation. Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, and more.

This is a chance to shape a new approach to knowledge representation from the ground up, working alongside a collaborative team driven to solve hard problems.

We’re hiring for the following openings:

* Product Software Engineering (Quantitative Modeling)

* Bayesian Software Engineering

* Program Synthesis Engineering

* Technical Project Manager

* Finance Manager - Corporate & Accounting
