Beacon AI | San Carlos, CA | Hybrid (On-Site) | Full-Time

We’re a mission-oriented company building pilot assistance technology that goes beyond what current autopilot (Level 1) automation can do by creating an AI pilot assistant (effectively R2-D2 for pilots). The platform will make aviation safer and more efficient. Our tech is deployed on the aircraft to help prevent accidents, reduce workload, and increase the effectiveness of both commercial and defense operators.

We’re a Series A, venture-backed startup, backed by: Sam Altman, Costanoa, Scout, and JetBlue. We’ve signed over 12 contracts with major defense and commercial players, and customer demand is growing rapidly, with significant milestones planned for next year!

Our current hiring focus is on the data platform and iOS software. https://beaconai.co/careers
