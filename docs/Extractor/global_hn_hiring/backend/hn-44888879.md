## 原始內容

LEGO | London (Farringdon) | Hybrid (3 days a week in the office)

* Lead engineer on the personalisation / recommendation engine

* Python, Node JS / TS, Databricks, Aurora RDS, AWS, API Gateway

* Experience required in both data engineering and software engineering

* Experience welcome in ML engineering and data science

I've worked on this team for a year or so now and it's fair to say that there's been no shortage of things to work on - you'll be immersed in the challenge of distributing personalised recommendations across the business and become a part of a company which adopts a lot of the nice danish working practices. The office culture is an important aspect of the business so 3 days a week is a needs-must. If this sounds like your bag - apply below:
