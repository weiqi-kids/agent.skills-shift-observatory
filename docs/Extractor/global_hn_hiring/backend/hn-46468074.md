## 原始內容

Starbridge | Senior Engineers (Kotlin/Java/React/Typescript) | NYC or Remote | Full-time | starbridge.ai Starbridge is building an AI platform that turns large-scale public and enterprise data into reliable sales insights. We are early, moving fast, and building from zero to one, so this role will have huge ownership and product impact. Product Engineer: (React/Typescript) who would work closely with product and design to build user-facing parts of the platform. You will craft performant, stable frontends that explain technical concepts to non-technical users and help us iterate fast based on customer feedback. AI Engineer: Applied AI plus strong software engineering. You will build, evaluate, and deploy LLM-driven features like deep document analysis and interactive chat, working with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. Expect hands-on Python, ML system design, experimentation, and production reliability. Bonus for RAG depth and frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Hugging Face. Backend Engineer: (looking for Kotlin/Java/Scala experience). You'll work across the backend: building enterprise integrations, large-scale scraping and parsing pipelines, and systems that let users apply LLMs to millions of documents to generate insights at scale. We're looking to build our in-person team in NYC but also open to remote! Apply: https://starbridge.ai/careers and mention HackerNews or email recruiting@starbridge.ai with your resume.
