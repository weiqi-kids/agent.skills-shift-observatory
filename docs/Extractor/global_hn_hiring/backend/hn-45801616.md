Kadoa | Web Scraping/Software Engineer | Remote | Full-Time | https://kadoa.com We’re automating web scraping at scale with AI. Web scraping used to be the same for decades (writing and maintaining rule-based scripts for each source), and we're fully automating that process with LLMs. We're also heavily focused on making ethical scraping the default (robots.txt checks, rate limiting, any custom compliance rules). But we can't do it alone. We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship, data, and AI. We are growing fast, have a “no-bullshit” policy, and try to minimize the distance between the code you write and the customers who use it. We iterate to greatness :) We're currently looking for a senior web scraping engineer: https://www.kadoa.com/careers/web-scraping-engineer If that sounds like you, please email me at (adrian at kadoa dot com) and mention HN in the subject line. Ideally you include an ETL or scraping project you've been working on in the past.
