## 原始內容

Spacelift | Remote (Europe) | Full-time | Senior Software Engineer | $80k-$110k+ (can go higher)

We're a VC-funded startup (just recently raised $51M Series C) building an infrastructure orchestrator and collaborative management platform for Infrastructure-as-Code – from OpenTofu, Terraform, Terragrunt, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Kubernetes, to Ansible.

We're now hiring for our new product, Spacelift Flows, built for more general DevOps (and related) automation - incident automation and response, self-service, slackbots, AI automations, building MCP servers, etc. We like to call it an "Integrated Automation Environment".

You can see a demo video of it here[0] with more videos available in the job post. Tech stack is Go + Postgres backend, along with TypeScript + React frontend.

Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. With the product being in it's early days, it's also a great opportunity to have a large impact!
