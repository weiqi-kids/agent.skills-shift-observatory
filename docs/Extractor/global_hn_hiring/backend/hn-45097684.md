  Roles:
  1. Head of Growth (SF)

We're building voice-first AI executive assistants for email and calendar management—think having a real assistant who actually gets things done. Backed by Y Combinator and other investors, we're at an extremely early stage and moving fast to hire our growth lead and early engineering team.

Head of Growth - Own the 0→100K user journey. Build content-led growth across LinkedIn/X/TikTok, run viral B2C experiments, and craft our brand voice. We need a proven track record of growing consumer products, content creation chops, and unreasonable excitement about retention curves. Extremely competitive salary + equity + user milestone bonuses.

Senior Software Engineer - Build the core backend for our AI assistant. 2-6 years of experience, TypeScript/Python, with consumer product background preferred. Work directly with founders on architecture decisions. Must work from the office. Competitive salary + early equity + quarterly performance hikes.
