## 原始內容
Mondrio | Software Engineer (Founding Team) | REMOTE (Brazil) | 3-Month Trial-to-Hire<p>B2B SaaS pricing is still guesswork. We’re building the AI-powered monetization operating system to fix it. We are pre-seed, lean (4 people), and shipping to live customers.<p>The Experience: This is a unique "fast-track" for an ambitious junior/mid-level engineer. You’ll skip the corporate ladder and learn to build an AI-native company from the ground floor. You will own features end-to-end—no managers, no layers.<p>AI-Native Workflow: We are all-in on Claude Code for scoping and shipping. You get a seat on Day 1. If you aren't already 10x-ing your output with AI tools, we’ll teach you. It’s the most essential skill for the next decade of engineering.<p>The Work:<p>Integrations: Build OAuth 2.0 flows and data sync pipelines for pilot customers.<p>Northstar Module: Build a strategic intelligence module from scratch (DB, Backend, Frontend integration. We have most of designs already).<p>AI Personas: Use LLMs to turn raw customer data into actionable pricing strategy.<p>Stack: Python 3.12 (Typed), FastAPI, MongoDB/Beanie, React/TS, Gemini/Claude, Claude Code, Google Cloud, Docker, Pulumi<p>Who You Are: You write clean, typed Python and can navigate a React component. You use AI tools (Cursor/Copilot) to move fast but remain the pilot. You care about the "Why" behind the product.<p>Process: Intro call → Technical session → Founder chat. Decision in ~7 days.<p>Apply: Send a link to something you’ve built to manon@mondrio.com
