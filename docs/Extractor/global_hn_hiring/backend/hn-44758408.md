Clio is the market leader in legaltech products and we recently raised a Series F round of 1.4 billion CAD to a valuation of 4 billion CAD, marking the largest Canadian tech funding in history (https://betakit.com/clio-tops-4-billion-cad-valuation-with-l...)

We also intend to acquire AI legal research tech company vLex to build a data moat with an estimated 1 billion searchable documents stored and ~50k new uploaded each day (https://betakit.com/clio-to-acquire-american-legaltech-vlex-...)

Some stats for Clio alone: 300MM+ ARR with 90% retention and 30% growth YoY / no debts / fortunate to have never done any layoffs. 1500+ staff before acquiring vLex, 450+ engineers, 55 eng teams.

* Security - currently ~20 engineers in 4 teams (offensive sec, defensive sec, infra sec, compliance) + standing up 1 net new team soon (product sec)

- Senior Infrastructure Security Engineer - infra is cloud-first on AWS with Kubernetes. 165K-172K CAD base salary + equity.

- Software Development Manager, Product Security - leans product software dev building for external sec features (rather than needing existing sec history or specialization). 205K-215K CAD base salary + equity.

* Machine Learning - currently ~30 engineers in 4 teams (MLE, MLOps, AI product dev x2) + still evolving especially after this vLex acquisition

- Senior Machine Learning Engineer - NLP, GenAI, fundamentals in statistical modelling and experimentation. Open to both Canada and US. 170K-179K CAD base salary + equity for Canada, ~200K USD base salary + equity for US.

- Senior MLOps Engineer - Python/Ruby, AWS, Kubernetes and Terraform. 170K-179K CAD base salary + equity.

* Others

- Senior + Staff Database Engineers - 2 separate roles, MySQL at massive scale. 165K-172K CAD base salary + equity for Senior and 200K-206K CAD + equity for Staff.

- Software Development Manager, CalendarRules - 60% performance management, 20% project planning (with dedicated PMs and Designers), 20% hands-on in the code building features with the team. Code is RoR but language agnostic in hiring process. Intentionally small teams to allow for managers to also code. 205K-215K CAD base salary + equity.
