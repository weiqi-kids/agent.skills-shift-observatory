Stealth | Product | Remote Anywhere | Full Time<p>Hello, I am bootstrapping an AI companion startup. I believe that within 10 years, more people will date AI than humans. I think this is neither good nor bad, just interesting, and I want to build something in this space.<p>- I am looking to hire someone to help with user interviews to define and iterate the MVP.
