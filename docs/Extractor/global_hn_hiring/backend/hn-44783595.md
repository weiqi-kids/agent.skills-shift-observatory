Hellas.AI | Remote | Full Time or Contract | https://hellas.ai

Hellas.AI is building a compiler for categorical deep learning to power decentralised, serverless AI.

We're looking for an experienced Rust engineer. You must have demonstrated:

* Experience in designing and implementing BFT consensus protocols
* Ability to engage with academic literature on distributed systems
* Understanding of ZK proofs and proof aggregation (you don't need to design these, but you should know how to use them)

Nice-to-have: interest or experience in:

* Deep Learning / ML / AI, GPU programming
* Compilers and array programming languages
* Category Theory and string diagrams

If you have project(s) demonstrating your experience in one or more of these areas, get in touch!

Our process is simple: we read code you've written and research you've published, then interview you about it. We don't do tedious coding tests.
