## 原始內容

Unto Labs | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE (Hybrid OK), REMOTE (US) | Full-Time
Unto Labs is developing the Thru Layer-1 blockchain (https://thru.org)

We recently announced $14.4 million in funding to make blockchains & digital assets useful for the world. Founded by Jump Crypto alumni and core contributors to the Solana protocol and the Firedancer client (https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer), we’re tackling fundamental scalability, performance, and usability challenges in distributed ledgers.

Our runtime conforms to the RISC-V specification—moving away from domain-specific VMs, DSLs, and bespoke compiler toolchains that limit developer and institutional adoption. You can write smart contracts and programs in any LLVM compatible programming language and reason about a standard ISA in RISC-V. Components are developed in C for maximal control over performance and resource usage.

We believe there is a unique window of opportunity to developer fairer, more accessible, and more global financial products on resilient public blockchains.

We are hiring for the following roles:

- Systems Engineer: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/unto-labs/13df6bea-b253-4c80-ae05-5...

- Software Engineer, Developer Tools: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/unto-labs/1ae2769b-1a67-41e2-a8d6-5...
