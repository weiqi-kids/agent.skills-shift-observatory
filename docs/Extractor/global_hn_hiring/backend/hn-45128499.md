Queueco | HFT | London, UK | Full time on-site | Visa sponsor

We are a proprietary trading firm operating in conventional as well as cutting-edge alternative markets. Our strategies run 24/7 without manual intervention powered by low-latency infrastructure and the latest machine learning techniques. We’re a meritocratic and lean team of highly-motivated scientists and developers and as such value technical ability more than politics: what matters is how good your code is, not how well you sell yourself. We spend no time dealing with clients, customers or investors and instead focus on growing our business by building better technology.

If you are a talented research engineer with strong developer skills who likes to work on low latency systems and large data science pipelines then please get in touch. We are also happy to sponsor exceptional talent.

You will be embedded within research and serve as primary resource for diverse software engineering challenges within the team. Your responsibilities will include efficiently processing extensive amounts of market data or improving the computational performance of live strategy code.
