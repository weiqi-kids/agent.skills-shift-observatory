## 原始內容

I'm a construction worker turned programmer doing data analysis for a few PhDs at a start up company. Recently got into machine learning and have been really going hard on it. In total I've been doing Python for about a decade.

Any advice for someone like me? I like my current job, but want to know where to go from here. Thanks for any advice.
