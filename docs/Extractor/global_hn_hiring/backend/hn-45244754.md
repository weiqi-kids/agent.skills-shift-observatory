Solitude Labs | Founding Engineer (Rust) | Full-time | Onsite Preferred | Miami Metro Area | 120k - 160k + Equity Package

At Solitude Labs, we're securing the future of the energy grid. Solar, batteries, EV chargers, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) are transforming how energy is produced and consumed. While they present endless opportunities to modernize our grid to make it more resilient and meet demand, they also create more entry points for bad actors to compromise the grid.

We're hiring a founding engineer to lead architecture and development of a decentralized, zero-trust cybersecurity platform for the distributed grid. You'll work across embedded and distributed systems, iterate quickly, and influence the core product.

Tech & experience:

5+ years software engineering

Strong in Rust (preferred) , or C/C++

Experience with grid tech (SCADA, EMS, ADMS, RTUs, PLCs)

Networking protocols: QUIC, TCP/IP, UDP

US citizenship required

This is a zero-to-one role. If you want to help protect critical infrastructure and innovate, send your resume over to careers@solitudelabs.com
