## 原始內容

DevOps Engineer | Reingold | Alexandria, VA or Raleigh, NC| Hybrid (2 days a week at our VA office or 1 day a week at our NC office)

At Reingold, DevOps isn’t just a support function; it’s a key part of how we deliver high-quality solutions for our clients. You’ll use a code-first approach to define and automate infrastructure, working with cross-functional teams to build systems that are secure, scalable, and repeatable. You’ll also develop fast, reliable deployment workflows that let teams ship code with confidence—and the observability that helps them own it in production, spot issues early, and fix them fast.

We’re looking for someone early in their DevOps career with real-world experience and the confidence to work independently on core infrastructure tasks. You don’t need to be a domain expert yet, but you should be hungry to learn, comfortable navigating unfamiliar systems, and confident in your ability to figure things out.
