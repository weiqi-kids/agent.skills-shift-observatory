Pliant / Backend Engineer / Engineering Manager / Remote (EU) / Full-time Pliant is rethinking corporate credit cards. Since 2020, we’ve been empowering companies to scale with modern virtual and physical card issuing, automated payment flows, real-time spend tracking, and a clean API that plugs directly into their finance stack. Our tech stack: Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot 3, Postgres, Kafka, AWS, Terraform. Our culture: low-ego, no-bullshit, high-ownership. Empowered product teams working closely with strong PMs. Pragmatic, impact-driven engineering. “Getting sh*t done” mindset encouraged.
