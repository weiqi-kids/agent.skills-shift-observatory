## 原始內容

Firetiger | Product Engineer | San Francisco | Full time, on-site Firetiger is building self-driving software operations. We believe the future of DevOps isn't better dashboards (like Datadog), but autonomous agents that monitor, investigate, and remediate issues based on high-level business goals. We are backed by Sequoia Capital and founded by Rustam and Achille, former leaders from Cloudflare and Segment. We are looking for a Product Engineer to build the interfaces between humans and AI agents running software on behalf of those humans.
