ZioSec Is Hiring a Senior Backend Engineer (Rust/PostgreSQL/GCP) - Remote

The Problem: Agentic AI systems are becoming increasingly powerful and autonomous. Most companies deploying them have no idea how vulnerable they are. We're building the offensive security platform that will become the industry standard for AI safety testing.

The Opportunity: Join us as our lead Backend Engineer and own critical infrastructure that will protect the next generation of AI systems. You'll architect high-performance Rust services that facilitate AI-driven attacks, manage complex state machines for AI agent interactions, and build the data pipeline that turns chaos into actionable security insights.
