Chronograph (chronograph.pe) | DevOps Engineer | Full-Time | Remote (US) | $140-160K USD + equity

Chronograph was founded to bring next-generation technology to private capital markets. Through our suite of cloud-based analytics and data management solutions, we help many of the world’s largest and most sophisticated venture capital, private equity, and credit funds understand their investment performance in unprecedented detail.

We are looking for a candidate with a generalist background in software development, including 3-5+ years of experience on DevOps, Platform Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), or MLOps teams. You’d be joining a small cross-functional team and have the chance to make critical contributions as we scale our engineering team and business.

Our ideal candidate has a passion for automating ops, troubleshooting infrastructure, and creating first-class developer experiences. On top of that, expertise with the following (or similar) tools/technologies is a strong signal of fit: Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Terraform, AWS, GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Nix, and Docker.

Note that while this is a remote position, travel to our NYC HQ 3x/year for "team week” on-sites is required.
