Saildrone | Multiple Roles | Onsite/Hybrid (US Only) | SF Bay Area (Alameda) | Full-Time | https://www.saildrone.com/

Saildrone is the world's leading collector of ocean related in situ data via uncrewed vehicle, above and below the sea surface. We work with governments, civic agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to derive better information about our oceans and seas - be it sailing drones into the eye of hurricanes to obtain new scientific storm data, mapping out the ocean floor, collecting new CO2 data in hard-to-reach areas, counting biomass to establish fishing quotas, or detecting and stopping illegal fishing and drug trafficking.

Maybe you saw that we've repeatedly hucked drones into category 4 hurricanes[1]. Or maybe that we recently completed a transoceanic cable survey for Meta[2]. And maybe you saw that we just wrapped up a big demonstration for our partners in NATO[3]. Or maybe you didn't see any of that, but you're still intrigued by the idea of autonomous, long endurance sailboats that help us better understand our planet.

Whatever the case, we're hiring for a breadth of different positions across our organization. In software, we're hiring for folks in our Perception, Platform, Frontend, and Vehicle teams. Stacks vary from team to team, but we're looking primarily for folks with backgrounds in C++, Python, and/or JavaScript (Node, TypeScript, React). All software positions are hybrid roles based out of Alameda, just a quick ferry ride across the Bay from San Francisco.

In addition to software engineers, we're also hiring for a bunch of other positions across the company in production/manufacturing, technical operations, and more.
