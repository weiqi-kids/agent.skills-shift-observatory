## 原始內容

AbbVie | AI/Software Engineer | Remote, UK/US/Canada ONLY | Full-time
Are you a great coder (Python/Typescript, but great skills are usually transferrable), who enjoys close collaboration with end-users in solving their hardest problems?

Do you have a solid foundation in the AI/LLM-world - or are you great at the above and willing to learn?

Are you well versed in data engineering concepts, and excited to work with the latest GenAI models and bring these solutions into production? Then I'd love to hear from you!

We are a small team who care deeply about our work as well as about each other. We iterate fast, and err on the side of prototyping and presenting something real, rather than spending hours in meetings and only producing slides.

Our vision for this project is extremely ambitious, and you will be a crucial part of making this a reality. We've been expanding the team over the past 6 months, and are currently looking to fill a few extra roles only in UK/US/Canada (location, not timezone).

If you fit the above description, hit me up at jakob.hoppermann@abbvie.com with your resume + a little bit about yourself!
