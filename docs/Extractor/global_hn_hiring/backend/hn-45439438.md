## 原始內容

Sumble is the newco from the founders of Kaggle. We are hiring software engineers, data engineers, machine learning/ai engineers, growth and a designer.

Can view our roles and apply here: https://apply.workable.com/sumble-inc/

As background, we are building a knowledge graph from web data with a first focus on data for go-to-market teams. We use web data to identify things like org structure, tech stack, and key projects (e.g., GenAI initiatives, cloud migrations). Our product already has strong product-market fit, early revenue, and happy customers — and now we’re ready to accelerate.

Our long-term vision is to become the primary destination for accessing high-quality web data. Try the product at sumble.com.

We are a team of 15, including 10 engineers with experience at companies such as Google, Meta, Stack Overflow, and Kaggle.
