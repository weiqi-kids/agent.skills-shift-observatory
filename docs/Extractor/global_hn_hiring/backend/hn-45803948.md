Speckle | Backend (Engineering), Founding Account Executive (Growth) | Full-Time | REMOTE | US East, London, EU | https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/speckle At Speckle [0], we’re on a mission to shake up the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. To do that, we're building the OSS data layer for AEC to operationalize how the built environment industry works with data and automation. Think of us as a cross between Github and Palantir, with an opportunity to significantly impact a $10 trillion industry. Our platform already powers workflows on billion dollar projects at leading firms like Suffolk, Multiconsult, Pomerleau, and Stantec. I'm the CEO/founder and I can honestly vouch that we're tight knit team that values autonomy and shipping cool product on top of our data layer (me included - and this might be a red flag for some, but it's my therapy) over hierarchy, politics, levels and complexity (my spirit animal is the grug brained developer). We love working together with our customers - construction is truly a unique place where each project is its own micro universe. We have multiple roles open across engineering and growth (sales & marketing) [1] [0] https://speckle.systems/about [1] https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/speckle
