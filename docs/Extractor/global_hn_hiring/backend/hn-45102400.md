We also intend to acquire AI legal research tech company vLex (Vincent AI) to build a data moat: https://betakit.com/clio-to-acquire-american-legaltech-vlex-...

Some stats: 300MM+ ARR with 90% retention and 30% growth YoY / no debts / fortunate to have never done any layoffs. 1500+ staff before acquiring vLex, 450+ engineers, 55 eng teams.

Security - currently ~20 engineers in 4 teams (offensive sec, defensive sec, infra sec, compliance) + standing up 1 net new team soon (product sec)
--> Intermediate/Senior Infrastructure Security Engineers - infra is cloud-first on AWS with Kubernetes. 130K-137K CAD base salary for Intermediate, 165K-172K CAD base salary + equity for Senior.

Machine Learning - currently ~30 engineers in 4 teams (MLE, MLOps, AI product dev x2) + still evolving especially after this vLex acquisition

--> Senior Machine Learning Engineer - NLP, GenAI, fundamentals in statistical modelling and experimentation. Open to both Canada and US. 175K-182K CAD base salary + equity for Canada, ~200K USD base salary + equity for US.

--> Senior MLOps Engineer - Python/Ruby, AWS, Kubernetes and Terraform. 175K-182K CAD base salary + equity.

Others

--> Senior + Staff Database Engineers - 2 separate roles, MySQL at massive scale. 165K-172K CAD base salary + equity for Senior and 200K-206K CAD + equity for Staff.

--> Senior Data Engineer - leans data platform and infra at scale rather than analytics. Billions of documents/PBs of unstructured text data. 165K-172K CAD base salary + equity.

--> Intermediate Platform Engineers - moving to PaaS from IaaS, Azure infra with Kubernetes and Terraform, programming experience preferred. EST-AST regions only. Remote Canada available. 130K CAD base salary.

--> Software Development Managers - 60% performance management, 20% project planning (with dedicated PMs and Designers), 20% hands-on in the code building features with the team. Code is RoR but language agnostic in hiring process. Intentionally small teams to allow for managers to also code. 205K-215K CAD base salary + equity.
