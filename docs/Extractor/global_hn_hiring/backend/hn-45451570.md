Meegos for soccer fans | Founding engineer | Remote | Full-time
Join Meegos as our Founding Engineer. Our goal is clear - build the most beloved  soccer app in the world. You'll own architecture, infrastructure, data pipelines, and end‑to‑end product experiences from day one. We're just getting started but have sights high, and the founding team to get there. You’ll prototype and ship fast, shape product direction alongside the founder, and leverage today’s best AI models and tools to deliver fan experiences no one else can. We’re looking for an AI‑native full‑stack builder fluent in React or React Native, Node or Python, SQL, modern APIs and integrations, with hands‑on experience using AI APIs and vector databases, strong communication, and 6+ hours overlap with PST. If you live the global soccer culture, thrive in early‑stage environments, and want meaningful equity, we’d love to hear from you — email josh@meegos.fun with your LinkedIn or resume and a note on why you’re a fit.
