## 原始內容

Count | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE (UK/Europe/US East Coast) | Full-time | £100–140k (or local equivalent) + Equity | https://count.co Count is an infinite, real-time canvas where SQL, Python, and low-code query cells live side-by-side with visualizations and freeform whiteboarding. It replaces the traditional linear notebook with a collaborative space for modeling, analysis, and presentation. Under the hood, we've built a custom WebGL rendering engine, data visualization library, graph-based modeling layer, and horizontally scalable compute engine (DuckDB-based) that dynamically shifts execution between browser and server to minimize latency and reduce database load. You'll help evolve the core platform: integrating agentic workflows into data exploration, pushing the performance limits of our distributed execution layer, and building powerful new analytics experiences used daily by customers. You'll have high autonomy and ownership over major parts of the product and technical roadmap, from architecture through production. Tech stack: TypeScript, Python, Node.js, WebAssembly, WebGL, Apache Arrow/Parquet, DuckDB, Kubernetes, React. Apply here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/count
