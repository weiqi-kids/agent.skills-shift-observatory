VersaFeed.com | SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (Python/Django) | REMOTE (USA ONLY) | Full-time

About us: Fancy ETL pipeline which processes products from huge ecommerce companies. Data extraction and massage, delivery to destinations like Google/Meta/TikTok/etc. Profitable, 15+ yrs stable, 100% employee-owned. No VC, no pointless meetings, just serious coding.

Stack: Python/Django, JavaScript, VueJS, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Docker, Git, AWS, AI/LLM integrations (OpenAI & Gemini).

Compensation: $150K–$220K USD/year DOE.

You: Senior dev who's seen (and fixed) enough dumpster-fire code to last a lifetime. Python/Django deeply internalized; ideally strong Vue (or React) skills. Git/Docker/REST are second nature. You’re the coder other devs come to when their stuff breaks: an architect-level thinker who’s rewritten ‘clever’ code into something that actually works. You play well with others and write code that’s easy to live with. Bonus: AI integrations, Py2→Py3 migrations, Snowflake (or Databricks) experience.

Timezones: Primary time zone is PST (standups at 9AM PST). Generally async-friendly but you must reside in the United States.

Benefits: 401K match, healthcare, equity, fully remote. Stable company with no time-wasters.
