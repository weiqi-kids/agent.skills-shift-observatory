Hi Hacker News, CrossnoKaye is a growing Series C company based in California, dedicated to tackling climate change by transforming how heavy industry operates. We’re building next-generation technology that helps industrial facilities run cleaner, smarter, and more efficiently. Our flagship platform, Energy AI, delivers measurable results — driving up to 20% reductions in energy consumption and cutting megaton-scale greenhouse gas emissions for some of the largest energy users in North America. We’re scaling quickly and looking for talented engineers who care deeply about innovation, sustainability, and meaningful impact. Our Software Engineering team develops a modern cloud-and-edge platform that enables real-time control, optimization, and AI-driven decision-making for complex industrial systems. We use and contribute to open-source technologies, including our own Goa microservice framework. Our stack includes AWS, Goa, Golang, React, Postgres, Druid, MongoDB, Kubernetes, Honeycomb, and Linux — all powering scalable, resilient, and data-rich applications. What we’re looking for: Senior Software Engineer-Python: (Remote USA) Your main responsibility will be to improve features in the existing software, troubleshoot, write clean code, and grow workflows in Python. You will work in close collaboration with the applied science team to build the next generation control system including predictive models and innovative control algorithms. Senior Software Engineer in Test (Remote USA) We’re looking for a hands-on engineer who loves Python, backend frameworks, and automated testing. You’ll design and implement test frameworks for our ATLAS and Energy AI platforms, ensuring reliability across distributed, cloud-based systems. Ideal for someone who loves writing clean and testable code. Senior Software Engineer – Control Systems Infrastructure (Remote – US) Seeking an experienced engineer to help architect and build scalable infrastructure for managing IIOT devices and distributed control systems. You’ll work across cloud and edge environments, handling deployment, observability, networking, and containerized systems at scale. Ideal for someone strong in Kubernetes, AWS, and systems-level engineering. Senior Software Engineer – Control Systems (Remote – US) Looking for a Go-focused engineer to design and maintain software running on distributed control agents that power real-time industrial operations. You’ll build and debug systems that generate and execute control strategies, stream live metrics to the cloud, and ensure reliable, secure communication across sites. Great fit for someone who thrives on systems-level development, real-time data, and turning complex technical problems into clean, production-ready solutions. Interested? Email careers@crossnokaye.com with your resume and include the position title in the subject line. We look forward to hearing from you!
