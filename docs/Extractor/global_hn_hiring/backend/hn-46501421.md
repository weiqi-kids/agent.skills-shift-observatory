## 原始內容

Viam | Senior & Staff Engineers Backend Engineers | NYC Hybrid 3 days (New York City) | https://www.viam.com/ Viam (founded by former co-founder/long-time CTO of MongodDB) is an open source robotics + AI developer platform. It is a single platform that brings software engineering maturity to robotics and automation. Why this could be interesting to you: Impact: ~100 people (~70 engineers) with only a handful at Staff level → huge room for influence. Proven, technical founder (MongoDB): → scaling with traction and real customers. Tech: Backend-focused teams (Core Services, Infrastructure, Motion Planning, Platform/Server) using Golang, MongoDB, Linux, GCP. Timing: Early enough to shape core architecture, late enough to see meaningful usage and scale. Contact amanda@viam.com or apply here: https://grnh.se/p755pzqr4us
