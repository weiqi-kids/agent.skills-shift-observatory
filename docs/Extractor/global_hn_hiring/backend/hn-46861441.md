SEEKING PARTNER | Bay Area | Applied Research Lab

Not a job. I’m exploring alignment with a potential partner.

I’m a systems builder (CS/infra founder; shut down my last startup) who spent the past two years going deep on foundational math that most engineers (and I guess many mathematicians) tend to ignore, largely at an nLab level, because standard abstractions stop composing.

I’m working toward a small, private apply-focus lab to bridge native CS intuition (computation, scale, systems) with structural, information-theoretic mathematics. The focus is composability, learning, universality, and complexity, with the intent to build, not publish.

The approach is unconventional, but intentional: staying close to real systems while reworking foundations when existing methods stop composing.

Looking for a self-funded generalist comfortable crossing CS, math, and theory that's interested in structure, information, ethics, and long-horizon work.
