CoPlane ( https://coplane.com/ ) | Design Engineer | NYC or Remote (North America) | Full Time The world doesn't need another ERP. CoPlane is building the Agentic Orchestration platform that enables enterprises to orchestrate intelligent processes across their existing systems. Founded by ex-Stripe/Segment product and tech leads, we're changing how businesses operate their backoffice - helping them scale intelligence not headcount. We're looking for an exceptional design engineer to grow our small team of engineers that include ex-founders, open source contributors (authors of neovim and neverthrow), and architects of petabyte-scale data platforms. You'll work with billion-dollar enterprises solving their hardest, most mission-critical automation problems. If you're excited about working at the nexus of data, automation and AI, and want to make a significant impact in an early, well-capitalized startup with large enterprise design partners, we'd love to hear from you. Roles: Product/Design Engineer. For more info and to apply: https://coplane.com/careers
