Zeno Group | Hybrid | US - NYC Hello everyone! I’m on the lookout for an SVP of AI & Tech Operations to join my team at Zeno Group. https://www.zenogroup.com We're a global, integrated communications agency, and one of PR Week's Best Places To Work 2025! • I’m shaping the technology landscape at Zeno from the ground up, which means juggling everything from procurement to infrastructure to education, and need someone who can help bring order to the chaos. We have a ton of amazing and passionate people and I (still!) only have two hands. • What you'll do is wear many hats, and so adaptability is 100% your most important attribute, along with: - Being a diplomat between Zeno and our sister companies - Leading AI+technology education and literacy programs - Performing discovery for and designing workflow automation - Convincing creatives that AI won't steal their Cannes Lions - Exploring turning random AI experiments into useful tools - Keeping up with AI exploration and experimentation because it’s something you do already • You need to be comfortable building with duct tape while executives ask why it's not done yet. Agency experience helps but isn't required; what matters is you can handle 72-hour deadlines, massive egos, and the phrase "the client changed their mind." • You also don’t buy the hype, and can cut through tech industry bullshit like a hot knife through AI slop. Being a practical cynic is a strength—you want to believe. • If you've successfully implemented some cool AI heat at scale and can explain it to people who still print emails, let's talk. • Hybrid role, based in NYC. Big on cultural fit. While this is not a client-facing role, some occasional face time with clients is expected. Here's the giant link to apply: https://djeholdings.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/ZenoCareers/job/Ne...
