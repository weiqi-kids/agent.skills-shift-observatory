We are a non-profit, independent research institute dedicated to shaping technology

with a core strategic focus on reinventing the practice of transdisciplinary scientific modeling.

We’re looking to hire our first full-time software engineer onto the US CatColab team.
We are open to hires at both intermediate and senior levels. This is a unique

benefit.
