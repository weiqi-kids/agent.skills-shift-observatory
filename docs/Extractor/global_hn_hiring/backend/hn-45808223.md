## 原始內容

Attendi | Senior Mobile Engineer | Amsterdam, Netherlands | ON-SITE hybrid | Full-time (80–100%) Healthcare professionals have to spend too much time on administrative tasks when they should be spending that time delivering great care. Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society. We are building the best-in-market speech-to-text and NLP solutions for Dutch healthcare professionals and are looking for an experienced Senior Mobile Engineer to lead the development of Attendi’s native mobile application. You will play a central role in bringing our voice-powered technology directly into the daily workflows of caregivers — designing, building, and maintaining high-performance native Android and iOS applications that make documentation effortless and personal. You’ll work closely with our backend and frontend engineers, designers, and product team to deliver a seamless, intuitive experience. This is a greenfield project where you’ll have end-to-end ownership: from architecture and UX considerations to release and continuous improvement. Your work will help bring Attendi’s vision of hands-free, human-centered healthcare to life. We have a dedicated team with fewer than 30 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We're post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market. Find out more and apply here: https://attendi.recruitee.com/o/senior-native-androidios-mob...
