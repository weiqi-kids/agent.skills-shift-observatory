Stytch | Various roles | San Francisco, CA ONSITE/HYBRID | https://stytch.com

Stytch helps developers protect their applications and make authentication that's simple and scalable, so that teams can stay focused on building differentiated products. That's various forms of signup/login flows, SSO and multi-tenant organization needs, integrated bot detection and fraud prevention, and more.

Beyond core authentication for humans, I'm also excited about our work in auth for AI: making it easy for companies to serve AI agents, and for AI agent developers to securely get things done. Stytch Connected Apps makes it easy to authenticate AI agents, and IsAgent and Device Fingerprinting help companies understand and control their AI traffic.

Personally, I enjoy working on interesting things, with the ability to make customer impact, and with great people. If you do too, consider joining us.

We are hiring for Software Engineer, DevRel/Marketing Engineer, Product Designer, and Solutions Engineer roles.
