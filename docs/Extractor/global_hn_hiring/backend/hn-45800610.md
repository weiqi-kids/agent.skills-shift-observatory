## 原始內容

LiveMap | Geospatial Data/Backend and Mobile Engineers | Full-Time | Switzerland or Remote (CH, EU, UK) Visa sponsorship is not provided. LiveMap is a funded startup with a vision to build the next generation of mapping apps (think hyper-personalised Google Maps). How that looks is still being explored so we're building prototypes, getting them into customer hands and iterating quickly. We're looking to bring on a couple of people to help accelerate this development process. As a data engineer you'll set up a data pipeline, work with product to identify relevant datasets, connect, persist and expose that data. As a mobile engineer you'll be the UI delivering value to the customer. We are testing hypothesis in weeks and leveraging tools like Claude Code to do it.
