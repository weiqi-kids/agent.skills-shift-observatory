BillionToOne (YC S17) | Menlo Park, CA; on-site or hybrid (US only) | Full-time
BillionToOne is ranked at the top 5% of Y Combinator companies with close to $400M in funding. In June 2024, we closed a $130M Series D resulting in a company valuation of over $1 billion. This funding has come from prestigious global institutional investors, including Hummingbird, Adams Street Partners, Neuberger Berman, Baillie Gifford, and Premji Invest.

We have developed a DNA molecular counter that increases cfDNA diagnostic resolution by over 1,000x. Our first product, Unity, is the first and only non-invasive prenatal test that can directly screen an unborn baby and assess its risk for: common and severe recessive gene disorders; chromosomal abnormalities; fetal sex; and fetal antigens from a single tube of blood from the pregnant mother. This greatly improves the quality of care and is on its path to becoming the next standard-of-care.

Our software stack includes Python/Django, React/Typescript, Terraform, AWS, and many other standard tools. We're a small, but nimble software team that prioritizes rapid iteration and continuous feedback to evolve our product. As a biotech company, we inherently need to always work cross functionally. If you enjoy this style of work, please reach out!

We're hiring software engineers, bioinformatics engineers, and many other roles. You can email me directly at kwu@billiontoone.com with your resume or apply through the links below.
