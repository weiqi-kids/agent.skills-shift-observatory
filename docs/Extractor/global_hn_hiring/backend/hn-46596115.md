## 原始內容

Upwave | Senior Software Engineer | REMOTE (US) | https://upwave.com Upwave is a YC/venture-funded startup that helps large enterprises plan, measure, and optimize brand advertising campaigns using advanced analytics and AI. We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients understand and improve how they're perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise. Our platform leverages AI to deliver deeper insights, automate complex analysis, and help marketers make data-driven decisions faster. We've been rapidly expanding our list of enterprise customers and deepening our integrations with "household name" partners. As we grow, we need engineers to help us build even more unique, differentiated, valuable, scalable, and robust analytical SaaS tools and products. About the Role: Upwave is a startup and we need an experienced generalist "startup engineer" who's experienced doing the wide variety of technical work that modern SaaS startups need. That includes backend web development (JVM frameworks), frontend SPA development (mostly React), AWS-based cloud engineering, data engineering, and working with AI/ML capabilities to enhance our analytics platform. Our team emphasizes high-quality, high-velocity, sustainable software development in a collaborative and inclusive team environment. We're a small team that gives our engineers a lot of autonomy, and we want people who are excited to step in and learn whatever's needed to get the job done (whether that's new technical skills or business domain knowledge.) If interested, email me: jason.kelly@upwave.com
