Cloudflare | Rust/DB engineers | SF/Austin/Seattle/NYC/London/Lisbon (Onsite) | Full-time<p>Hey HN, I'm hiring engineers for the new Cloudflare Data Platform (<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-data-platform" rel="nofollow">https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-data-platform</a>). We do streaming ingest and processing, managed Iceberg catalogs, and a distributed query engine—all built on R2 and the Cloudflare Edge. We're making it ridiculously easy for Cloudflare customers to build data lakes.<p>I'm looking for Rust engineers with experience working on databases, stream processing engines, and query engines. You'll get to work on incredibly cool tech on a huge scale.<p>Note: we are hiring for on-site roles in one of our engineering hubs, not hiring remote at this time.<p>If you're interested, shoot me an email (in profile) with subject HN and a brief description of your background and interest in the role.
