## 原始內容

Synthropic | Detection Engineer + GenAI | Full-time / Part-time | Remote (SF)

We're an early-stage startup looking for someone passionate about detection engineering and generative AI.

If you know SIEM, threat intel, logs, detection modeling/strategy, purple teaming, and adversary emulation — and you've been wanting to explore how LLMs/agents can accelerate detection engineering workflows — we'd love to talk.

The role
A lot of it is what we call AI babysitting: guiding 1,000 kindergarteners (LLMs) as they try to become senior detection engineers. Sometimes they're brilliant, sometimes chaotic — your job is to shape that into something production-ready.

You'll be part detection engineer, part researcher, part builder, with a big say in shaping the product and how AI gets applied to real-world problems.

Details
Full-time or part-time
Remote-friendly (SF-based, local a plus but not required)
Early team, high ownership, fast iteration
