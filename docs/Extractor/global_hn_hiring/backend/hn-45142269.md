Guilde (https://guilde.ai) | Staff Engineer + Senior Engineer | Full-Time | Remote (Americas & Canada)

Do you run multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously, constantly tinker with new prompting techniques, and juggle a half dozen side projects? If you want to live AI all day, every day and build software you actually want to use, join us. We're four repeat founders who previously built StrongDM ($150M from Sequoia). 
Guilde transforms the firehose of new techniques, tools & models into the future of SDLC.

I'm Schuyler, one of the founders. If you'd like to join us, email hiring [at] guilde.ai with "HN: Staff SWE" in the subject line

What you’ll tackle:
* Agentic workflows: deterministic orchestration with retries, audits, and cost controls.

* Eval & policy systems: golden datasets, regression baselines, policy-as-code gates.Integrations: Linear, Datadog, and other developer tools.
