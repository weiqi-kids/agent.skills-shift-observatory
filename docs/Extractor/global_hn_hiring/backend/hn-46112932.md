## 原始內容

Tandem Health | Software Engineers | On-site in Stockholm, Sweden | Full time At Tandem Health we're building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and are already rolling out across some of the largest care chains across Europe, including most of the NHS. Our core product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. Some even tell us that their partners notice they're much more relaxed after starting to use our product, and we couldn't be happier :) We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers! We use Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend) and C# (Windows app) and our infrastructure runs on Kubernetes in Azure. Even if we don’t have a role out your specific skill set, we’d love to talk! Our tech team is small but growing and you’ll have an outsized impact on an important problem.
