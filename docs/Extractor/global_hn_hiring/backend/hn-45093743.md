## 原始內容

Channel3 | NYC | $120–200K + 0.5–1.5% equity | Full-time

Channel3 is hiring a Founding Engineer to help us build a database of every product on the internet.

Our API lets any AI app or agent add shopping capabilities and earn commission on sales. As commerce moves from in-store, to online, to AI-native, this universal product catalog becomes critical infrastructure. We see Channel3 becoming as foundational to AI commerce as Stripe is to payments or Plaid is to fintech.

We just closed a $6M seed round led by Matrix (Apple, FedEx, AfterPay) with participation from Ludlow (Honey, StockX), Y Combinator, and Paul Graham. We're live with 500+ developers on our API and millions of products processed daily.

We're looking for engineers who want direct ownership of technical decisions, love solving hard problems at scale, and want to help build our team and culture from the ground up.

This role is in person, 5 days a week, in NYC. Unfortunately, we cannot sponsor visas.
