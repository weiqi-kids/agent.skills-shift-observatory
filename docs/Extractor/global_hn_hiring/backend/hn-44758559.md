About the project:

We create tools for healthcare organizations that help patients find care (https://www.sparkle.health/).

* Our team is international and all remote, but mostly overlaps with the Pacific or Central time zone.

* Our developers work with near-autonomy toward shared goals. We don't micro-manage.

* We actively maintain work/life balance and reject crunch culture. We work hard to foster an atmosphere of independence and trust.
