## 原始內容

Parsnip (https://parsnip.ai/) is an app like "Duolingo for cooking", powered by an AI-enabled personalized learning platform that works for many domains beyond cooking. Our mission is to build AI that empowers people to be the best version of themselves.

We're hiring a UX/product designer to work on this AI system, and are looking for someone with strengths in data visualization, interaction design, educational design, and general systems thinking to own a good chunk of the direction of this AI-native product.

Here's a bit more about both the consumer app and the AI system, and how to get in touch: https://parsnips.notion.site/product-designer

REMOTE-first with a focus around Eastern Time, and a team between Central European Time to ET. We also have a physical office in NYC.
