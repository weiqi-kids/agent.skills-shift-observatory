Stellar (https://stellarcs.ai) | Founding Software Engineers | Amsterdam, the Netherlands | Full-time | No Visa Sponsorship

Stellar is building the go-to AI voice agent platform for customer support, enabling incredibly human-like customer service over the phone. We're a young and rapidly growing startup that has already proven traction, with a number of well-known companies among our initial customers.

To see some of our AI voice agents in action, see https://www.stellarcs.ai/demo-showcase

We're  looking for founding software engineers to help us scale Stellar's platform globally. As one of the first members of our engineering team, you’ll play a key role in Stellar's journey and have the opportunity to help shape our architecture, engineering culture and product and engineering roadmap.

Tech stack: Go, Node.js, Typescript, React, Next.js, Encore Cloud, GCP

What you’ll do:

- Build performant APIs and backend services in Go and Typescript (Node.js)

- Develop Stellar's frontend in React, TypeScript and NextJS, to allow companies to effectively design, test, deploy and monitor their AI voice agents

- Design a scalable, fault-tolerant system architecture that can handle large volumes of concurrent real-time audio conversations & agent interactions while maintaining low latency

- Work on Stellar's AI agent framework, at the intersection of software engineering and AI engineering

- Design and implement a platform that meets enterprise standards in terms of security, compliance, resilience and data privacy

- Build API integrations with external systems to enhance the capabilities of Stellar's agents

- Help shape the early engineering culture as one of the first hires of a young and growing tech startup

Why join: you'll be joining at a pivotal time in our growth, in a role with a high degree of ownership and strong growth potential. Join a small but talented team, coming from high growth startups and scale-ups such Framer, MessageBird, Adyen and Crisp.
