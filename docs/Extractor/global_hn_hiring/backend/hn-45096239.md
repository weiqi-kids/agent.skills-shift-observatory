Common Prefix | Software Engineers / Auditors | Greece | Remote | Full-time

Common Prefix is a science-first blockchain consulting company. Our vision is to make blockchains usable for mainstream users and everyday people – paying at the supermarket, remittances, moving money across borders, saving, investing – and solving the real problems of usability, scalability, and interoperability that come with it. We're a 30-person team, half scientists (cryptographer PhDs, post-docs, and professors) from renowned universities, half engineers with long web2 experience. A lot of our field is broken and we're trying to make a small contribution in fixing it, by introducing provable security and proper engineering practices across the board.

What we're looking for:

Software engineers who can solve problems, are smart, get things done, and enjoy working on the bleeding edge, learning about cryptography, and working from first-principles.

Auditors who can write and read code, especially low-level cryptographic implementation code (zero knowledge verifiers, signature schemes, etc), consensus (PoW, PoS), or smart contracts (everything DeFi).

Tech stack: Doesn't matter, we'll teach you. But we work mostly with Rust.

Open roles:

* Software Engineer, https://commonprefix.notion.site/sw-folk

* Auditor, https://commonprefix.notion.site/auditing-folk

We offer:

- $80,000–$160,000 / year cash
- Local from Athens, Greece, or remote, preferably in Europe
- Conference participation in exciting scientific and engineering venues, 2-3 times per year
- The opportunity to work and learn from world-class scientists from major universities in the field of blockchains, cryptography, and consensus

If you're interested in joining our team, please reach out to careerscommonprefixcom with the subject line "HN: ".
