Immunant | Systems Programmer | REMOTE (US only) | Full-time | $120k - $150k + retirement benefits

If you're interested in low-level, resource-constrained and privileged execution environments, consider joining our team of compiler, OS, and Rust enthusiasts.

At Immunant, we spend much time staring at weird build errors, ISA or ABI documentation, or digging through obscure build systems or C code written 20 years ago. In any case, we strive to make the systems we're working on more secure, more efficient, and have more Rust in them (whenever we get a chance).

We also maintain and enhance the fully open source c2rust translation framework.

If you have recent, professional experience with C/C++ and Rust and know about operating systems, hypervisor internals, or compilers, we'd love to hear from you. Candidates with only superficial knowledge in all of these areas are not encouraged to apply. Please note that we can only consider candidates resident in the US.

We offer a remote-friendly, collaborative work environment with a high degree of autonomy and competitive benefits.

To apply: team@immunant.com

We look forward to hearing from you!
