CoPlane (https://coplane.com/) | Infra (BYOC) Platform Eng and Product/Design Engineer | Remote (North America) or NYC | Full Time

The world doesn't need another ERP. CoPlane is building the Agentic Orchestration platform that enables enterprises to orchestrate intelligent processes across their existing systems. Founded by ex-Stripe/Segment product and tech leads, we're changing how businesses operate their backoffice - helping them scale intelligence not headcount.

We're looking for exceptional engineers to grow our small founding team of engineers that include ex-founders, open source contributors (authors of neovim and neverthrow), and architects of petabyte-scale data platforms. You'll work with billion-dollar enterprises solving their hardest, most mission-critical automation problems.

If you're excited about working at the nexus of data, automation and AI, and want to make a significant impact in an early, well-capitalized startup with large enterprise design partners, we'd love to hear from you.

Roles: Platform Engineer (Infra), and Product/Design Engineer.
