OnFrontiers | Senior Engineer | Hybrid/Remote | NYC or Baltimore

OnFrontiers is hiring a strong senior engineer with experience programming agents to lead development of our agentic intelligence platform for government contractors.

We're looking for a passionate, curious engineer, who wants to work closely with our founding team and contribute as both a technical expert and a member of the product leadership.

In the role, you'll lead development of our indexing services, LLM integrations and APIs, as well as our SaaS platform, as we continue to scale. The role is hands-on but has the potential to grow into management as the team scales.

Core technologies include OpenSearch, Postgres & PGVector, Go, Python and React, all running on AWS.
