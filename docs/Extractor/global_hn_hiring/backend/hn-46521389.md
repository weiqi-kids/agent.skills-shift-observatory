## 原始內容

Kato | Senior Software Engineer | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE | Full-time Kato is building a compliance-first AI servicing platform for the $24B lending market. While others treat regulatory guardrails as an afterthought, we’ve built a regulatory rules system with an AI decision engine on top. Our first product is a Voice AI agent currently handling loan servicing calls for major fintechs like Bilt Rewards and Parafin. We are backed by Pear VC and angels from Brex, Bridge, and Square. You’ll be our second engineering hire, working directly with our CTO (ex-Google/Brex EM) and CEO (ex-Goldman/Brex). The Role: As an early hire, you’ll own mission-critical projects across the entire stack. You’ll lead the architecture of our real-time voice processing system, optimize LLM integrations for compliance-aware conversations, and build out our customer-facing dashboards. Tech Stack: Backend: Golang, PostgreSQL Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind Infra: AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker AI/ML: LLMs, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech Requirements: 2-5 years of production software experience. Strong API design and architectural thinking. An "owner's mindset"—we are a small, high-intensity team where everyone drives product direction. Experience with WebRTC, real-time audio, or FinTech is a plus but not required. Location: San Francisco (4 days/week in-person).
