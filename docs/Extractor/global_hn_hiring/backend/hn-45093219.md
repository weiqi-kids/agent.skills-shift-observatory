Revere Defense Technologies - Autonomous Networks and Infrastructure

San Francisco (Dogpatch) | On-site w/ flexibility | Full-time | Multiple Roles, $120k–220k + equity + benefits

Why: Comms are contested. Radios make you a target, satellites aren’t guaranteed, and brittle legacy networks won’t survive future fights.

What: We’re building an autonomous maritime network — think distributed systems in the ocean—extending resilient comms, sensing and compute to the edge in high-threat remote environments.

Who we are looking for:

- Software Engineers: large-scale distributed systems, networking, system design, embedded software, DevOps rollouts. Python, C++, Rust. Bonus: SDR, mesh, security.

- Electrical Engineers: PCB layout, embedded, RF, circuits, power/batteries, electro-mechanical. Bonus: DSP.

- Marine/Mechanical Engineers: pressure vessels, subsea robotics, gliders, ruggedized design; DFM, reliability, field deployment.

You will: ship code to robots, test on the water, move fast, own big surface area, and work directly with military operators.

About Us: Our founding team includes a Navy SEAL veteran, defense industry engineers, builders, hackers, and watermen (sailors, boaters, divers, fishermen). We’re focused on real future missions — not legacy requirements. Venture-backed; public launch soon.

Eligibility for a TS/SCI security clearance is a plus. Please send a short note + resume/portfolio to jobs@reveredefense.co with subject HN – Engineering.
