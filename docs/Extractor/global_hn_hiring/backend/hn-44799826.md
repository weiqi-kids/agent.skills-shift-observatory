## 原始內容

Rabbet (YC S17) | Sr. Software Engineer (Elixir/React) | REMOTE (TX, NC, CO) | Full time

Rabbet is hiring Sr. Software Engineers to help us streamline construction finances. We offer cloud-based software for commercial lenders and real estate developers to centralize construction finances, automate administrative tasks, and reduce the time spent managing draws.

Backend is in Elixir (Phoenix/Absinthe/postgres), frontend is React (mostly JS with more new stuff in TS). The company is ~20 people with 7 of us on the engineering team. Looking to add another 2-3 engineers over the next ~6 months.

We are fully remote, though we do require candidates to be in TX, NC, or CO (exceptions possible if you have several years of professional Elixir experience). We don't currently offer sponsorship.
