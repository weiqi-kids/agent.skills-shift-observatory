Stardrift (https://stardrift.ai) | Founding Engineer | Onsite - SF | Full time

Hi HN - I'm the founder of Stardrift, and we're looking for a founding engineer to join our team of 3-4. (Fun fact: I got my first coding job through 'Who is hiring?', almost 12 years ago!)

We are building a world-class travel search experience. In the future, you won’t book travel by opening ten tabs in Google Flights; you’ll book through a personalized AI assistant that understands everything about you and automatically arranges your trip for you.

You'll tackle everything from optimizing LLM performance and building evals to integrating APIs like Amadeus and Duffel. We care about moving fast and writing high-quality code; your job will be to take customer feedback and improve our product, working shoulder-to-shoulder with me & the rest of the founding team.

Please reach out to leila@stardrift.ai to apply.
