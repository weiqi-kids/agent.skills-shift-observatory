## 原始內容
Sent an email out just a bit ago! Please let me know if it doesn't arrive for whatever reason.

EDIT: Looks like my comment was detached from its thread (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46857847) without a comment explaining why. It's not breaking any of the stated rules at the top, and it seems like it would be common sense to let someone know they should expect a message (especially considering how temperamental email filtering can be these days). If this _is_ against the rules, I'd appreciate it if future hiring threads stated as such so that people like myself that have been trying to find a job for 7+ months can stop wasting our time here. I understand how it can be challenging to moderate a forum like HN, but the moderation priorities seem pretty disappointing, unfortunately.
