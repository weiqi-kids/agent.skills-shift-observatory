Polar Sky | Founding AI Lead | Bay Area/Seattle | Hybrid/Onsite | Full-time

We're a well-funded, pre-seed cybersecurity startup focused on data security. I'm looking for a founding AI lead with experience in fine-tuning LLMs (expertise around RL + reasoning models a big plus). This person would own the full AI stack from data to training to eval to test-time compute.

Who's a good fit:

* If you've always thought about starting a company, but for whatever reason (funding, life, idea), this is a great opportunity to be part of the founding team. We're 2 people right now.

* You enjoy understanding customer problems and their use cases, and then figuring out the best solution (sometimes technical, sometimes not) to their problems.

* You want to help figure out what a company looks like in this AI era.

* You enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge.

Questions, interest, just email jobs@polarsky.ai.
