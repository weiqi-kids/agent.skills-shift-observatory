Narrative I/O | Senior Backend & Frontend Engineer positions | New York, NY | Full-time | REMOTE (4-hour overlap with EST for backend, US & Canada for frontend) | $120k to $200k USD | https://narrative.io/

Narrative has been building a data collaboration platform designed for simplicity and ease of use since being founded in 2016.

Our primary strength is functioning as a data marketplace where we differentiate ourselves by automatically standardizing data, 
making platform data accessible through the Narrative Query Language (NQL), 
giving data providers the ability to define row-level access and pricing policies, 
and making it easy to deliver data to a variety of destinations using our "Connector Framework".

We operate two flavours of our platform: An AWS-based implementation that runs on our infrastructure, 
and a Snowflake-based version running inside the user's Snowflake account.

We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. 
While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), 
Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Québec), Poland, and Serbia.

In brief, the technologies we use are:

- Backend: Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, Apache Calcite, Cats, Cats-Effect, Http4s, FS2, Doobie, Deequ, Axolotl, BentoML, and HuggingFace Transformers.

- Frontend: Typescript, VueJS, Nuxt, Vite, and Cloudflare Pages.

- Operations: AWS (ECR, ECS, EMR, RDS, S3, etc.), Datadog, Docker, Terraform, with some burgeoning use of EKS/Kubernetes.

Job postings and more on information about our team and culture are available at: https://jobs.narrative.io/

Apply by sending your resume to hiring-dev@narrative.io.
