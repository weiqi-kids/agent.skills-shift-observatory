Tailscale is modernizing the way we connect our devices and services together and building a connectivity platform. We are rapidly growing across almost all areas of the business right now and that includes DevRel. The linked role is a video heavy one, but we're also looking for a Social Media Manager / Video Editor. We'll also soon be looking for a DevRel Engineer too.

There are dozens of other positions available too across Eng, Sales, and the whole company - see them all at https://tailscale.com/careers#open-job-positions
