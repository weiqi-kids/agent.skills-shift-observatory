# Memorang (Vercel + Shopify for EdTech) | Full-Time | Remote # Our mission is impactful: To build the "AI stack for education." Our platform combines knowledge graphs, agents, and apps to provide an all-in-one toolkit to rapidly launch new content and apps. We bootstrapped to profitability, won the inaugural Vercel AI Accelerator (out of 1,500 startups), and now power the official content and apps for career sectors like aviation, healthcare, and even your local barber. If your goal is to stave off the existential threat of AI to the workforce by accelerating the learning journeys of tens of millions of professionals, this might be the right startup for you. # Our stack is awesome: Vercel, Supabase, Neo4j, Langchain, Expo # Our roles are open: -Staff/Product/Infra Engineers: Ship mission-critical features and rapidly iterate from proof-of-concept to production across the stack. -Agent Engineer/Architects: Build our agent network and champion our open-source learning protocol to make education systems interoperable. -Graph Engineer/Architects: Enable subject-matter experts to build novel ontologies, give agents rich context to take meaningful action, and help build our AI/graph-native spaced repetition memory system. -Product Designers: Do you believe that AI should be the new UI? Reimagine user interaction patterns to shift from task-driven to goal-driven design. From our agent and app builders to the first agent-native learning app platform. -Technical Product Managers: (1) Drive our SaaS/SDK platform to empower builders; (2) Drive our AI Apps platform to empower learners. # Why Memorang? - You want a remote-first, async-friendly team with flexible hours - You appreciate health & wellness stipends, home-office support, paid time off - You thrive when given ownership and autonomy to implement fresh ideas - You have the talent and drive to solve hard technical problems that actually make a difference # How to apply: ## Blue Pill: Apply here: ( https://memorang.com/careers ) or email careers@memorang.com with your CV, a short note (1–3 sentences) about which role excites you and why, and a link to your best project or portfolio. ## Red Pill: Uncover the specific technique we're using to fingerprint applicants who use AI in their cover letters when applying via the normal route. (Hint: It's on the job description pages). Email us with your findings, and, if correct, you'll skip straight past inbox purgatory and into the shortlist for an interview.
