CourtDrive | Principal AI Engineer  | REMOTE| Market | Full-time | https://www.courtdrive.com/

At CourtDrive.com, we are building an AI Docketing Assistant that enables law firms and other power courthouse website users to become more efficient by automating daily tasks. We’re based in Los Angeles but have a remote team worldwide (Canada, Europe, Armenia to name a few). Your role as Principal AI Engineer will be to lead CourtDrive's AI strategy through model evaluation, fine-tuning, and data collection. You'll work alongside our engineering team to bring AI features from concept to production, while elevating the team's understanding of language model capabilities and best practices. Your expertise will be crucial in determining how we can best leverage AI to enhance our solution.

This role offers a unique opportunity to apply deep language model experience in a product focused on transforming how law firms practice the business of law.

Testimonial from a team member: “Long story, but I worked there for maybe 6ish months part time a while back. They offered me full time, but I ended up going to a startup because I wanted to learn some specific technologies + up my skills in Data Science. That job was definitely good for some people, but it wasn’t as remote as they advertised it (had me fly in a lot), and the team was somewhat difficult to work with ;) I ended up starting my own consulting and at the same time CourtDrive reached back out to me (perfect timing). Point I was trying to make was that I went back to work with them because they were so nice to work with. Not super demanding and very open to listening to ideas/suggestions - just a pleasant environment.”
