About You: You have a passion for doing things The Right Way, you believe Less is More, you want to focus on Foundations of system design and architecture (pacelc, consistency guarantees), you care as much about the code you do not write, you’re tired of the hype treadmill and care about the fundamentals. You have battle scars from overengineered and underperforming slop, and you care about writing code that lasts.
