## 原始內容

Houmanoids | https://houmanoids.com | Lots of roles

We're integrating robots in and around buildings (focused in America for now). Example usecases:

- security guards, doormen, receptionists (low mobility using humanoids)

- security patrol around perimeter of buildings (high mobility using dogs)

- moving things/packages within a building (last step package delivery)

We are building on top of Unitree's hardware and there's lots to do.

- abstraction layer similar to Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android

- appstore

- example reference apps (think mail, calculator, camera, maps)

996 work environment due to collaboration/communication requirements with folks in China and insatiable demand for deploying robots.

deploy at houmanoids.com goes to myself (founder) and cto/cofounder
