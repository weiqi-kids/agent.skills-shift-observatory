Nebula | Multiple roles | Remote/Onsite NYC preferred | Full-time

Nebula is building a modular blockchain stack to make on-chain finance faster, fairer, and more efficient than off-chain. The stack has 3 parts:

1. Execution environment – combines Rust + Sovereign SDK for highly performant, expressive private apps (e.g. solving latency asymmetry in exchanges).
2. Privacy protocol – blends cryptography + privacy hardware for verifiable, fast programmable privacy.
3. Nebula Exchange – a hyper-performant exchange using batch auctions + private orders to eliminate latency asymmetry and guarantee best prices.
We’re hiring ambitious engineers to join the core team:

- Frontend (React/TS/Next.js) – focus on architecture, design systems, interactivity, realtime apps, Figma → production.

- Backend (Rust/Go) – core infra + SDK integration.

Requirements: detail-obsessed, independent problem solver, thrives in chaos, good communicator, can work ET hours.
Nice to have: exp. in financial exchanges, realtime data-heavy apps, web3.
Note: workload can be intense (sometimes 80+ hrs/wk).
