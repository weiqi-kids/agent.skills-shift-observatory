At Formal [0], we’re rethinking serverless from scratch: we’re building a new computing stack for instant, globally available, truly elastic, soundly isolated execution. We leverage formal methods and languages to build OS interfaces with low overhead, formally verified isolation without containers or VMs. Our immediate goal is to write a new programming language to replace eBPF and build the world's first serverless networking infrastructure.

We are a 5-person, VC-funded team with PhDs from Stanford, UW, OSU, and Brown, advised by professors from MIT and UWaterloo. We are currently hiring for the following four positions:

- [1] Staff Software Engineer: Compilers, Programming Languages, and Verification (≥ $200k + ≥ 0.5%)

- [2] Formal Verification Engineer: Formal Methods and Programming Languages ($120k - $200k + ≥ 0.25%)

- [3] Software Engineer: Compilers and Programming Languages ($100k - $175k + ≥ 0.2%)

- [4] Formal Methods PhD Intern: Formal Methods and Programming Languages (≥ $5k / month)

Please see [5] for general information. To apply, email us at (work at formalstack dot com) and let us know how your experiences fit the role and its requirements.
