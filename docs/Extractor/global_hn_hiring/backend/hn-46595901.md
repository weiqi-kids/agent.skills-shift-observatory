Larridin | AI Native Software Engineer (All Levels) — Bay Area, In-Office Larridin is the measurement layer for AI in the enterprise. We’re building AI-native systems that correlate AI behavior to business results, expose absorption bottlenecks, and enable enterprises to invest with conviction. Backed my top tier investors such as a16z, Google and Bloomberg and with early traction! We want high-agency software builders (3–10 yrs) who think AI-first, move fast, and want ownership of large parts of product and business. This is an in-office role in the Bay Area for engineers who want to own outcomes, not just tickets. DM' me on Linkedin to apply: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ameyakanitkar/ This is also primarily backend focussed role.
