Fyxed.com | Fintech Engineers | Fully Remote Fyxed deploys capital to landlords and their property managers for cash needs like repairs, turnovers, and improvements on rental properties. We're at an inflection point where we have the deployment capital ($50M) to really take a big swing at this opportunity. The perfect candidate has prior fintech (lending) experience, loves wrangling the complexities of reconciling/tracking money, and bonus points if you've built on top of Column.com's API.
