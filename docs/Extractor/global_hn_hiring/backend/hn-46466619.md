Kyber is a multi-stream and multi-actuator transport in extremely-low latency, over Quic; it encloses the server, the client and the protocol. One could use Kyber to control robots, drones, desktop, servers in the cloud or just remote rendering of interactive 3D programs. Kyber is done for Remote RealTime, where every millisecond matters. Kyber is developed by engineers from the VLC and FFmpeg community, and we code in Rust, in C and in assembly. We have some development in Go too. We're a quite technical team, but cool to work with.
