## 原始內容

Attendi | ML Platform Engineer | Amsterdam, Netherlands | ON-SITE hybrid | Full-time (80-100%)

Healthcare professionals have to spend too much time on administrative tasks when they should be spending that time delivering great care. Attendi allows healthcare professionals to report with their voice. This saves them precious time and removes the screen between client and caregiver, allowing more personal and effective care to be given. Burdened by an aging population, the healthcare sector is in desperate need of innovators like Attendi. We feel that we provide an extraordinary work environment: getting paid well to work with smart people on things that actually have a positive impact on society.

We are building the best-in-market speech-to-text and NLP solutions for Dutch health care professionals, and are looking for an experienced ML Platform Engineer to support in building and optimising our ML and data infrastructure with a focus on reliability, performance, and scalability. You will contribute to research and innovation, helping expand the capabilities of our AI-driven tools, building the next generation of our Speech-to-Text Engine — expanding into new domains and reaching a broader range of healthcare professionals.

We have a dedicated team with fewer than 25 members, which means no bullshit, moving fast, and getting a generous slice of equity. We're post product-market fit, profitable, and on the cusp of scaling up in the Dutch market.
