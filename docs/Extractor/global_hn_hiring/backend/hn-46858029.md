    You must be independent and self-organized.

    Good at Go, Kubernetes (Understanding how to manage stateful services in a multi-cloud environment) and Distributed Systems in general.

    SQL / ClickHouse SQL (goes without saying)

    You'll need to be able to do On-Call - debugging production infra or db issues

    If you can do low-level database programming (C++, ClickHouse) that's added bonus.</code></pre>
If you want to work on operating production critical databases in the cloud on k8s + write data-driven algorithms for autoscaling, consider applying!
