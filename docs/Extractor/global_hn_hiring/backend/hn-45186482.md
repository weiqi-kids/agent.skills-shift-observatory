Replai (www.replai.io) | Senior Developer | Remote with option to work in office SF  | Full-time

We're focused in producing high scales of high quality CGI content (think Game of Thrones) using automations (usually in Python) on products as Autodesk Maya.

We're growing fast and we're profitable and currently investing in our own growth dozens of millions/year.

We're forming a new team of 10 elite developers with the goal of decreasing our animation times to be able to create thousands of hours of the most developed animations for dragons/animals/3D worlds.

We're looking for experienced people able to do it all and quickly reach unreasonable and unlogical goals for the top companies in the world.

Email me at francisco.pacheco@replai.io if you're interested and explain why
