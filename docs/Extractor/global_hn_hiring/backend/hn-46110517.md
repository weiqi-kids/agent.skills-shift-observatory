## 原始內容

Viam | Staff Software Engineer & Senior Software Engineer, Infrastructure | Onsite 3 days (New York City/NYC) | https://www.viam.com/ Viam (founded by former co-founder/long-time CTO of MongodDB) is an open source robotics + AI developer platform. It is a single platform that brings software engineering maturity to robotics and automation. Why this could be interesting to you: Impact: ~100 people (~70 engineers) with only a handful at Staff level → huge room for influence. Proven, technical founder: → scaling with traction and real customers. Tech: Backend-focused teams (Core Services, Infrastructure, Motion Planning) using Golang, MongoDB, Linux, GCP. Timing: Early enough to shape core architecture, late enough to see meaningful usage and scale. Apply here: https://grnh.se/cxoto5ac4us
