Turnstile (https://www.tryturnstile.com) | REMOTE (US/Canada) | Product Manager (Sr) | $185k-205k salary + equity

---

We're a small (23-person) team of repeat founders and seasoned operators building a next-gen quote-to-cash platform. This is a tight-knit and senior crew — most of us have 10-25 years' experience, much of it together. The last company we built, Second Measure (YC S15), scaled to 70+ people and tens of millions in revenue, and was ultimately acquired by Bloomberg in a landmark deal.

We've built a category-defining product and are now gearing up to scale. We're looking for our third Product Manager to help shape the future of our platform.

We're well-funded by top investors (First Round plus more to be announced), fully distributed, and known (and recognized) for building intentional, inclusive culture. We offer competitive global rates (SF salary + equity), equal pay by level, and comprehensive, family-friendly benefits.

I'm Mike, one of the founders— if interested, apply here (https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/turnstile/3ef0ec7d-325f-421d-82ec-4...) and mention this post.
