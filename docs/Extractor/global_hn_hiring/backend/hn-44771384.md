Stellar | Amsterdam, the Netherlands | Onsite (2 days remote OK) | €70-100k + equity | https://stellarcs.ai

Hey, I'm one of Stellar's founders. We're building voice AI for large contact centers.

Everyone thinks contact centers are boring. They're wrong. It's the last place where companies actually talk to their customers. We listen to calls every week and it's fascinating. AI here actually helps real people: shorter wait times, 24/7 support, lower cost.

Stellar skips the robotic text-to-speech pipeline entirely and works directly with voice. Our conversations are remarkably human, also in non-English languages and local dialects, where most AI sounds like a bad GPS navigator. 
On top of this, we're great at integrating with the complex systems at enterprises, and meeting their compliance requirements.

We're cash-flow positive, growing fast with enterprise clients queuing up, and all founders still code. We need engineers who can jump between our Go and TS backends and React frontend. This role is perfect if you:

* Want massive ownership at a small team (not pretend "impact" at BigCo)

* Actually enjoy solving hard problems (real-time audio at enterprise scale)

* Think making AI sound human in niche dialects is a fun challenge
