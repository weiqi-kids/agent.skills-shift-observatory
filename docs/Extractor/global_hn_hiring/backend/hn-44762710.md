At Nomi, we're building AI companions that form deeply meaningful, humanlike relationships and immersive roleplaying experiences. With over a million users growing at ~10% month-over-month, your work directly impacts millions of lives. Our users tell us we've helped them find self-worth, leave unhealthy relationships, try therapy, and even save their lives. See countless real user testimonials here: https://nomi.ai/spotlight/ and our recent news coverage here https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/human-ai-relationships-love-...

As an ML Engineer or Senior ML Engineer, you'll lead innovation in large language model (LLM) post-training, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic capabilities, directly shaping how users connect with our AI.

We offer:

    * Full autonomy to experiment and deploy cutting-edge ML techniques
    * A fully remote, async culture emphasizing results over meetings
    * International team with visa sponsorship available
    * For US employees: 401k (100% match up to 5%), fully covered health insurance, equity

Great to haves:

    * Extensive hands on experience with things such as multinode training, rlhf, knowledge distillation, test time compute, rag
    * Up to date with SOTA in LLM post training (would love to hear what research paper you think is or would be most impactful for our roadmap!)
    * Genuine passion for our product, finds the idea of engaging with our community on Discord/Reddit to be a pro (it is a very different experience than developing enterprise software!)
    * A high internal bar for excellence and relentless drive
