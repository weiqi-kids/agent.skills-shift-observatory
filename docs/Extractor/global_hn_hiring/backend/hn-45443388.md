## 原始內容

Zoca | AI Engineer | Full-time | Bangalore (In-office)

I'm Shambhav, CTO & co-founder at Zoca. I'm building a team to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

So far, we've built a platform from Bangalore that has outperformed every competitor in our space — small businesses happily pay us 10x our competitors' price because our agents actually work. These agents work like real business partners, generate leads, do followups, book appointments, manage reviews and more. We're already powering growth for over a thousand businesses.

In the next 12 months, we're going to scale this to tens of thousands, while making the agents smarter, more reliable, and capable of things people think aren't possible today. We'll be working on technical challenges like multi-channel conversations, browser automation at scale, retrieval pipelines, and real-time monitoring/eval loops.

I need AI Engineers who want to build like founders — not paper over things in a research repo, but ship production systems that touch real users. Strong TS/Python skills, a builder's mindset, and a track record of actually building (agents, GSoC projects, or similar) is what I'm looking for.

If this excites you, send me an email at shambhav@zoca.com with your working demos or GitHub profile. Show me what you've hacked on.
