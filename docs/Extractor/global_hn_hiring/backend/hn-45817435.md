## 原始內容

Compass IoT | https://www.compassiot.com.au | ONSITE with Flex (Sydney, AU) | $130-180k AUD Compass is hiring a full-time front-end developer. I'm Emily, one of the founders. We are a multi-award-winning start-up that uses connected vehicle data to help transport professionals build better, safer, cities across ANZ, the UK, and USA. This includes B2B and B2G (gov). Notably, our dev team consists of ex-Canva, ex-Huawei, and ex-Agoda. We're bootstrapped, financially stable, and in our 7th year of operations. The company is employee-owned and has a generous performance-based equity scheme. We value our company culture and work hard to provide meaningful career experiences for all staff, including projects that have changed the transport policy landscape in at least 3 different countries. We care about your experience at work and provide opportunities to grow and learn cool stuff. Our goal is to have a relatively small, motivated team of highly-paid, nice people who feel they are working on projects with tangible impact. Requirements: - At least 3 years of experience. Ideally, your experience would be in front-end, but back-end development experience is also valuable. - Ideally, you would have some knowledge and/or experience in Typescript, React, State management (Jotai and MobX highly regarded), CSS Modules, Mapbox or similar. - Nice-to-haves include Async generators and promises, Protobuf, and GCP. The role is onsite with flex; we ask new staff to come into the office during their first few months so that they get to know the team and the tech, but are open to more hybrid after the initial onboarding period. We're a relatively small (25 people) team. We value people who are collaborative, problem solvers, flexible thinkers, take ownership over problems, and are do-ers who leave their ego at the door. Other cool stuff: - Almost all Australian state govs use our software to improve roads and safety - We helped change the law in NZ around digital road pricing - We've won +7 different awards, including one from Google - We keep a well-stocked snack fridge and keep you caffeinated Chuck us an email at directors@compassiot.com.au with a CV and github/project portfolio.
