## 原始內容

Entourage | REMOTE | Principal AI Engineer – Collective‑Memory / Multi‑Agent Systems | Full‑time + meaningful equity

We’re building the shared‑memory protocol that lets AI agents learn from each other, turning isolated tools into a network of collective intelligence. Incubated by Moonsong Labs (creators of Kluster.ai, Moonbeam, Tanssi).

What you’ll do
- Design and ship distributed infrastructure that captures, validates, and surfaces agent experiences in real time.
- Operationalise SOTA research in LLMs, RL, and multi‑agent coordination into fault‑tolerant, low‑latency services.
- Turn episodic trajectories into reusable knowledge for a growing ecosystem of mutually distrusting agents.
- Set technical standards, mentor engineers, and grow the AI platform team.

Tech you’ll touch
Python, Rust/Go, LangGraph / AutoGen / CrewAI, vector & graph stores, Temporal / Kafka, k8s, Terraform, modern GPU/cloud stacks. Web3, consensus, or token‑incentive know‑how is a nice‑to‑have.

You bring
- A record of shipping complex AI or distributed‑systems platforms (startup or research labs welcome).
- Deep appreciation of LLM post‑training, multi‑agent frameworks, and end‑to‑end MLOps.
- MSc or (ideally) PhD in a STEM field; 5 + yrs hands‑on engineering.
- Desire to lead and still stay close to code.

Why Entourage
- Green‑field architecture, zero legacy.
- Direct impact on the connective tissue of the coming agent economy.
- Competitive salary, generous equity, hardware budget, London hub with quarterly off‑sites.
- Inclusive culture – we hire for talent and potential, not pedigree.
