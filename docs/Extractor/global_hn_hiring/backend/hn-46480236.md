Stardrift ( https://stardrift.ai ) | Founding Engineer | Onsite - SF | Full time Hi HN - I'm the founder of Stardrift, and we're looking for a founding engineer to join our team of 3. We are building a world-class travel agent experience. In the future, you won’t book travel by opening ten tabs in Google Flights; you’ll book through a personalized AI assistant that understands everything about you and automatically arranges your trip for you. You'll tackle everything from optimizing LLM performance and building evals to integrating with APIs for rail and flight networks around the world. We care about moving fast and writing high-quality code; your job will be to take customer feedback and improve our product, working with me & the rest of the founding team. Here's a tech blog we wrote about some of the systems engineering we do: https://stardrift.ai/blog/streaming-resumptions . You can find more info at https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/stardrift/jobs/nC7cjhB... . Email leila@stardrift.ai to apply.
