Ataraxis AI | Backend / DevOps Engineer | Full Time | NYC preferred, Remote US possible

Hi, I'm the co-founder and CEO of Ataraxis. We are developing AI-native tools to help physicians select optimal cancer treatment. We recently raised a $20m Series A and I'm looking for a software engineer with strong backend skills who likes devops work.

This role will include work on platform, infrastructure, and data. However, we are also looking for someone who will lead work on security & compliance (from HIPAA and SOC2 to regulatory submissions). You need to be proficient with Python. You are going to lead the infra development for our systems that are going to help patients around the world get the right cancer drugs.
