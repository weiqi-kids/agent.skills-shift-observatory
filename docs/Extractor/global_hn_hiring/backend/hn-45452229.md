SalesJack is a sales software platform (CRM, Prospecting Service) for independent businesses in the construction supply industry. We are growing quickly and profitably. Our founding team and customers are based in the US, and we aim to grow engineering capabilities in Canada.

This role is responsible for leading our data pipelines development. SalesJack operates data ETLs from sources like client ERPs (enterprise resource platforms) and municipality open data to power our CRM features. You will collaborate directly with founders and lead engineers at the company and help:

- Enable scalability in our pipelines as we onboard more customers and data sources

- Setup visibility, monitoring and alerting in all parts of our ETL processes

- Allow plugging in AI led transformations at the right stages of our pipelines, and enable this to be done easily

- Lead RnD effort for AI toolings that transform a lot of manual work in the industry

We are looking for:

- 3+ years of data wrangling and pipeline scaling experience. We prefer if you have done so with a focus on reliability and efficiency (both in terms of compute and costs) in the past.

- Someone who loves experimenting with data, regularly tries out new tools, and enjoys exploring the possibilities of AI and machine learning—especially large language models (LLMs)—we want to hear from you.

Our hiring process will be:

1. Initial call with our founding engineer to briefly discuss your experience and introduce SalesJack ~ 30mins

2. Technical Exercise (this will a live coding on a screen-sharing call where we will ask you to work on some problem) ~1.5 hours

3. Call with one of our founders to see cultural fit ~ 30mins

4. Offer

We aim to have the full process take no more than 2 weeks from the initial call.

This is a hybrid role, with in-person 2-3 times a week in Downtown Hamilton, Ontario.
