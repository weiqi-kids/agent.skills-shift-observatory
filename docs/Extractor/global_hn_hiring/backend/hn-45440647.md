CampusOptics | Product Engineer | Hybrid ~2x/wk | Austin, TX | Full-Time

CampusOptics is an environmental health and safety platform for universities. We're hitting product market fit, quickly adding customers, and looking to add another product engineer to our engineering team of 5.

Most importantly, you're excited to work in a close-knit team to build features without bureaucracy and make a big impact in our Rails/Hotwire application. And you'll influence a product that makes a material impact on campus safety. The ideal candidate would have UI/UX/product sensibilities, and we're open to all levels of seniortiy.

I'm a founder, the CTO, and the hiring manager for this role. I got my professional start on "Who's Hiring March 2011", so I'm partial to candidates from here :)

You can see more details here: https://gist.github.com/jpcody/82f33ff98afedaca7018082933019...

To apply, I'd love to hear why you think you'd be a good fit and what excites you about the role at jcody@campusoptics.com.
