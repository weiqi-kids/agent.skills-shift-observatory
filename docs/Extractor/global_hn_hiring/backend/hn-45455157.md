Jupiter Health | Founding Engineer | New York City (In-person 4 days / remote 1 day in Union Square) | Full-Time | $200K + equity
Jupiter is building a better approach to healthcare for 80 million working age Americans like you and me.

We all know that healthcare is broken. In large part, this is because too much quality, pricing, and access data has been hidden from view, and there are too many intermediaries creating complexity between consumers and the care they need. At Jupiter, we are creating a more direct, flexible, and responsive healthcare system that better serves working-age Americans.

Our triple aim: Improve your health, improve your financials, and make it convenient and easy.

We have built a proprietary dataset of over 12 million direct pay rates across 40,000 providers, covering all types of sites of care in the US, from hospitals, surgery centers, imaging, diagnostics, specialists, primary care, urgent care, virtual care, physical therapy, dental, and vision.

We are now building out our consumer search product which we aim to scale up rapidly in 2026.

We are looking for a Founding Engineer energized by our mission and eager to be part of the founding team at a startup tackling a massive market.
