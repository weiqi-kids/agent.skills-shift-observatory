WireScreen (Series A) | Senior Software Engineer | NYC - hybrid | Full-time | $165k-$200k base + equity | https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/wirescreen/158fd72f-fc2f-47a3-bdb5-...

WireScreen is a fast-growing Sequoia-backed Series A startup building the go-to open source intelligence platform for navigating global supply chains and China-related risk. While China maintains some of the world’s most detailed corporate ownership records, the real challenge is connecting the dots. That’s where we come in—surfacing the networks, relationships, and financial ties behind companies to support national security, compliance, and regulatory oversight.

We’re hiring on the backend to help solve one of the hardest problems in data engineering: building a production knowledge graph from millions of fragmented, inconsistent Chinese corporate records where traditional approaches break down. Our PySpark/EMR/Airflow pipeline is just the foundation.  The real challenges are in entity resolution across transliterated names and obfuscated ownership structures, bipartite matching algorithms and inferring relationships. We build our product on top of that with a Django/FastAPI/React stack to help our users access that knowledge graph to analyze and investigate any risks they should be aware of.

If you have prior startup experience, can bring strong Python (PySpark is a big plus) experience and have previously worked with TB-scale data sets - we’d love to talk to you.

Happy to answer any questions - you can reach out to me here or at leo.green@wirescreen.ai - I'm a recruiter with WireScreen, but if I don't know the answer I'll ping our engineering folks and come back to you fast.
