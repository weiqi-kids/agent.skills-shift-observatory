Oils (https://oils.pub/) | Language Engineer / Debugger of Other People’s Cursed Shell Programs / Writer | REMOTE (non-US) | 50 euros/hour

Oils is our upgrade path from bash to a better language and runtime.

We’ve been awarded a 4th grant from https://nlnet.nl, and our focus is to show that OSH can be the ONLY shell on a Unix system, which is hard

It looks like we will reach this goal!  Other than me, there are 4 people working PART TIME on this, and we can use more help.

If you like hunting down difficult bugs, and are skilled at Unix and Python, this could be a good fit.

Most bugs are too hard for 1 person to fix by themselves, so communication is important.  And writing good test cases is important.

We’re also paying people to do polished writing, since we'd like to spread the word

Starting from 131, we’re down to 41 disagreements between OSH and sh/ash/bash, when building ~1600 packages in Alpine Linux

https://op.oils.pub/aports-build/published.html

Anyone who's not “scared” of these bugs is probably a good fit, and you can do as much or as little as you like.  This is also an opportunity to get deeper into the interpreter

Communication happens on Zulip, and we also have video meetings approximately every 2 weeks

I'll have a blog post explaining this work soon, but feel free to e-mail me if this (unusual) job matches your interests. Any questions are very welcome, and you can dip your toes in to see if it works for you

I wrote this page a few years ago to help people assess the fit: https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Where-Contributor...

The job is remote-only, and we slightly prefer non-US contributors due to our funding

Tech stack: Python, Shell, perhaps C++
