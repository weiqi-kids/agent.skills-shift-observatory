Link11 | QA Engineer | Remote (EU time zone) | Full-time | https://www.link11.com

As one of our QA Engineers, you'll be the guardian of product excellence - thinking like a hacker, testing like a detective, and ensuring our complex systems work flawlessly in the wild. You'll go beyond finding bugs to anticipating the unexpected: edge cases, weird component interactions, and those "no user would ever do this... but what if?" scenarios that separate good products from great ones.

What You'll Own:

* Design battle-tested strategies that catch issues before customers do

* Build automated test suites that scale with our ambitions

* Hunt down bugs across complex component interactions and configurations

* Partner with dev teams to ship quality at speed

* Be the voice of risk assessment when it matters most

You Should Have:

* Critical thinking that connects dots others miss

* Deep web tech knowledge (HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SSL/TLS, CDN)

* Automation chops (Python, JavaScript, Bash)

* Experience with test methodologies and writing bulletproof test cases

* Debugging skills that turn logs into insights

* Communication skills that turn complex issues into clear actions

Why Join?

You'll be testing cybersecurity products that defend critical infrastructure against DDoS attacks –  a single bug could mean the difference between stopping an attack in https://www.link11.com/en/blog/jobs/qa-engineer-remote-first...
