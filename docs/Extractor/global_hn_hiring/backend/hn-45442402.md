Actively AI| Multiple Roles | In office in NYC | Salary + Equity

What Cursor has done to revolutionize coding, we are looking to do for revenue. Every large company spends 40-50 cents of every dollar they earn on sales & marketing, and it’s very inefficient because data lives in so many different systems, sales reps are stretched thin doing manual work, and products are rapidly evolving.

It’s why we are building the agent and intelligence framework for enterprise scale GTM that guides every sales motion across the funnel — from SDR outreach to AE deal strategy to cross-sell and expansion. It’s an intelligence layer that sits on top of every sales tool and with external browsing that is then customized to your specific products & GTM motions.

It’s a massive technical challenge:
- Intelligence at scale: modeling millions of accounts, real-time signals, and contextual history into per-account reasoning agents.
- AI Agents & Chat: designing systems across “push” (recommendations) and “pull” (interactive assistants), with extensible skills customers can train themselves.
- Data & Infrastructure: creating a new framework for real-time, per-customer agents that simplifies pipelines, scales efficiently, and cuts costs (we’ve already cut cost per account by 50% through smarter eval-driven approaches).
- Wall-to-wall product: from self-serve UI to Slack integrations, from predictive models to generative copilots — we’re building an AI operating layer for GTM.

Why Join Engineering at Actively:
- Customer-driven impact: engineers directly go onsite and spend time with customers, deploying agents that reshape workflows at companies like Samsara and Justworks.
- Category creation: there’s a huge opportunity to build the pre-dominant AI company for GTM with a massive TAM
- Cutting-edge AI: opportunity to push the frontier of reasoning agents, eval-driven development, and scalable intelligence.
- High-caliber peers: we’re ex-Instacart, Scale AI, Stanford AI researchers, and operators who’ve built at scale before.
