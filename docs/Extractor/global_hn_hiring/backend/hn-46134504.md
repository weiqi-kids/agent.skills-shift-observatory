## 原始內容

Return | REMOTE | Software engineer backend (Go/Golang) | Full-time Return ( https://return.energy ) is hiring a software engineer who will work on platforms that accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Return’s main activity is building and operating industrial-size Battery Energy Storage Systems. Our operations are located in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Spain. You will be making a measurable (country-level) impact on the transition to renewable energy. Return recently raised €300M to support its growth. While we employ over 100 people, Return’s technical team is still small (13 people). Our platform automates processes in energy storage, monitoring, market optimization, sales, project management, procurement, construction, and customer service. During the first three years of operation, we laid the foundation for our platforms, and we are ready to scale up. This is why we are looking for an experienced software engineer. Your primary focus will be to further develop our battery virtualization platform that enables our customers to use slices of battery capacity distributed across our fleet of industrial-scale batteries. Our tech stack/toolset is straightforward: Go, Python, Ruby, PostgreSQL, TigerData, dbt, Dagster, Grafana, Terraform, self-hosted + cloud compute. We tend to keep meetings to a minimum in order to provide at least five hours of uninterrupted coding time per day. We practice code reviews and apply automated and manual testing. Our web apps and platforms are often deployed multiple times per day. Return has offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid, and Stuttgart. We are very much open to working remotely as long as you live in the EU. Our hiring process is swift but thorough: a brief call to get acquainted and discuss financials, followed by one or more technical interviews, and a paid visit to Amsterdam to meet the team. The tech team members have co-founded several companies and/or have experience with remote development teams since 2008. They will personally help you through most of the recruiting process (there is no recruiter involved). Apply here: https://jobs.polymer.co/return/37860
