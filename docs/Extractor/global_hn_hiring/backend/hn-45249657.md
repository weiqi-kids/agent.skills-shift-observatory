## 原始內容

Friendsurance | Sr. Back-End Engineer (Java) | Full-Time | Hybrid | Berlin, Germany | Relocation

"Dealing with insurance should bring a smile to your face"
- We’ve been chasing that bold mission for 14 years — still founder-led, still independent, and one of the very first Berlin fintech startups that is still around and thus deeply connected.

We operate in the bancassurance domain and serve German Banks and Insurances, exploring international expansion.
Our flagship product is a B2B2C Multi-Tenant Whitelabel SaaS platform.

Our team is small, our culture is high-supportive/low-directive, and our stack is pragmatic Java. We experiment with AI prototypes, but we value engineers who care more about clean code and thoughtful tradeoffs than the latest hype.

We’re hiring for Germany (hybrid, relocation supported) — if you’re curious, say hi!
