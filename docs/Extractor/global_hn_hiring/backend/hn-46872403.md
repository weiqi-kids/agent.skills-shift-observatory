Modal builds the serverless cloud used by many of the most popular AI companies you've heard of. People use Modal for inference, training, batch operations and also, sandboxes. A good example is the Ramp Inspect tool, that was built on Modal sandboxes. https://engineering.ramp.com/post/why-we-built-our-backgroun...

I am one of the hiring managers here, hiring for the Product Engineering team that builds the observability tooling for our developers. Modal is the cloud for many of our customers and we help them reason about what's happening in their systems, help them expand their use and generally have a good experience.

Feel free to reach out directly at can@modal.com if you are interested in that role.. Modal is hiring in SF, NYC, and Stockholm. My team is primarily in NYC, and this is an in-office role.
