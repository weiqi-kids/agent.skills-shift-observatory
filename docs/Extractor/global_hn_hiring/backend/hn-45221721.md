Censys | Senior SRE & Staff Software Engineer Roles | Full Time | Remote US

Hey everyone. I'm a Principal Engineer at Censys. We are the source for Internet Intelligence. We conduct a full internet survey every day and turn that into actionable data for folks to identify risk, research emerging internet threats, and make the internet a safer place. If you also get a bunch of data breach mailers in your mail box every year, you're familiar with the impact of security breaches at tech companies. We're trying to put a stop to that by helping companies understand their risk and mitigate it.

HQ is in Ann Arbor, MI, but we're all over the US. We're looking for a Senior SRE to help improve reliability and developer experience, and a Staff Software Engineer to join our Attack Surface Management product team. If you're a little bit more senior or junior than either of the postings, please do still apply. We care a lot more about getting the right people than we do matching the level exactly to the posting.

Please please apply to these role if:

- You can take ownership of improving a part of the product (Staff SWE) or the application platform we build for product engineers (SRE).

- You're game to navigate the messy middle of a small, nimble company with really high customer expectations. You'll have to navigate some ambiguity to be successful in either of these roles - don't expect pristine PRDs coming down from on high.

Our application stack is primarily Go and TypeScript with some seasoning of Python here and there where appropriate. Our primary cloud is in GCP and we also maintain our own physical servers (prior experience with physical hardware is great, but not required).

The links below will cause you to show up as a social referral from me. Feel free to reach out to me directly on Linked In (https://www.linkedin.com/in/farmdawgnation/) with any questions.
