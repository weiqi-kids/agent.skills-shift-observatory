String (https://www.usestring.ai/) | Founding Engineer | ONSITE - NYC, SF | $170k-220k salary + equity and benefits | Will sponsor any visa

Collecting data from the web is painful with custom scripts everywhere, Cloudflare roadblocks, and pricey infrastructure.

I’m Rohit, the CEO at String, where we are building the first scraping platform that just works. In the last two years, with a small team of five, we have:

- Acquired dozens of enterprise customers generating 7 figures of ARR

- Built infra to reliably scrape 30M+ pages per week

- Raised a seed round from leading VCs/angels in the space while being cash flow positive

Our engineering culture emphasizes speed, ownership, and autonomy. We are building at the forefront of scraping and AI and would love to meet if this sounds interesting to you.
