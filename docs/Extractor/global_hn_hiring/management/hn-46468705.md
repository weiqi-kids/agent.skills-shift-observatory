## 原始內容

ProPublica | Director of Product Engineering | Remote (US only) or NYC | Full-time ProPublica is a non-profit newsroom that investigates abuses of trust in the public interest. Journalism we published last year shed light on the impact of DOGE and ICE, investigated right-wing militias, told stories about the US medical system, and more. Here were our most-read stories in 2025: https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-most-read-stor... I'm the Senior Director of Technology. I'm hiring a pragmatic, mission-driven Director of Product Engineering, who will report to me, in order to provide more support for our product engineers who work on our publishing and data products. (This is not a reporting position.) You'll directly lead and manage a small team of engineers and help us to create and maintain great engineering processes. More about the role here, including a direct route to apply: https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/propublica/jobs/4623874006?... Or get in touch with me at ben.werdmuller [at] propublica.org if you'd like to have a conversation about it. The expected salary range for this position is $170,000 to $180,000. We cannot sponsor visas and must hire in the US. The role is almost fully remote: we have two in-person week-long summits a year.
