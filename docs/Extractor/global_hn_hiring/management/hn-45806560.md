NVIDIA | vLLM + SGLang | Deep Learning Inference | Remote (North America preferred) Hi everyone — I’m Akbar, Senior Manager of Deep Learning Inference Software at NVIDIA. I lead our engineering efforts around vLLM and SGLang, two of the most widely used open-source LLM inference frameworks. We’re building teams focused on making LLM inference faster, more efficient, and more reliable at scale — from runtime and scheduling optimizations to kernel fusion, distributed serving, and continuous integration across new GPU architectures (Hopper, Blackwell, etc.). We’re hiring for multiple roles: • Senior Deep Learning Software Engineer, Inference ( https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NVIDIAExternalCareerSit... ) • Engineering Manager, Deep Learning Inference ( https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/NVIDIAExternalCareerSit... ) • DL Performance Software Engineer - LLM Inference ( https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCar... ) • DL Performance Software Engineer - LLM Inference ( https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCar... ) These roles are remote-friendly (North America preferred) and fully focused on upstream open-source development — working directly with the maintainers and the wider AI community. If you’re excited about large-scale inference, compiler/runtime performance, and pushing GPUs to their limits, we’d love to talk.
