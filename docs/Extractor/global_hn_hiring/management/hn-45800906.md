PlantingSpace | Full-time | Remote (EU time zone) + Quarterly Meet-ups | https://planting.space We’re building an AI system for analysts and scientists, based on a fundamentally new approach to reasoning and knowledge representation. Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more. This is an opportunity for senior engineers and product managers to join us and help shape a deep-tech product from its earliest stage. We're currently seeking talented individuals for the following openings: * Program Synthesis Engineer * Bayesian Software Engineer * Senior Product Manager Learn more, see role details, and apply via: https://planting.space/joinus/ Questions? We'd be happy to hear from you at: talent@planting.space
