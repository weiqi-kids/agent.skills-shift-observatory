You'll own and operate our Quality Management System across multiple devices (SaMD + hardware) and be directly responsible for FDA/ISO-aligned documentation, design controls, supplier quality, clinical-quality support, and software validation oversight. You'll work directly with the COO/CPO (me), CTO, and our Director of Clinical Research. Please email Joan at jmeo@neurovrd.com with a resume & cover letter about why this work matters to you.
