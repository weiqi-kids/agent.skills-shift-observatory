Mulligan Post, Inc - On-Site near Millbrae BART/CalTrain Station in Burlingame - $60-120/hour Contract - Mechanical Design Engineer / Mechatronics / Industrial Automation. Software hacker seeking hardware hacker to make custom robots for Magic: The Gathering automated storage and retrieval system to power an online e-commerce store (think CardKingdom competitor or eventual TCGPlayer competitor.) In terms of scale, the eventual target is >100k different _skus_, million items in inventory, tens of thousands picks per day. The industry is large; eBay bought TCGPlayer for $300M about 3 years ago. I am looking for a mechanical/electrical/hardware generalist to complement my software expertise. Someone who knows how to integrate off the shelf parts into custom automation to solve problems. If fast iterations, direct connection with the project in use, autonomy and minimal bullshit overhead appeals to you then this could be a great fit. You are: someone who makes stuff and solves problems, is a clear communicator and fast study. You know how to challenge a requirement, source an off-the-shelf-part or design custom manufacturable part and when to do each. I don't really care where or when or what your degree is in if you have demonstrated driving things to completion and we vibe well enough. We will use OnShape (license/seat will be provided) for collaboration and document management reasons. Much of what we need to build is integrating FUYU linear rails, Clearpath motors, pneumatics with some custom Send Cut Send / Xometry parts, 8020 frames, etc. Pros: Small team / minimal overhead and wide scope. Clear guidance on what to build. Flexible-ish schedule (core hours 9-5 in office, flexibility for school breaks, etc.) Real problem with established market. While I'm primarily looking for a contractor for now, I am open to the possibility of bringing the right person on full-time with equity if they are interested and invested in the space, but that is not a requirement and it probably makes sense to establish that after working together for a bit. No recruiters or third parties, not able to sponsor at this time. Compensation dependent on experience. Hiring process: resume/project review, vc chat paid 1-day work trial where we see if we fit. If you're interested, send me an email - hiring@mulliganpost.com
