MUZ11 | Growth Hacker/Partner | REMOTE | Revenue Share MUZ11 ( https://muz11.com ) is a new music streaming platform specifically designed for developers and professionals who listen to music while coding/working. I'm building the default music player for focused work sessions. I'm seeking experienced growth hackers for a partnership role focused on acquiring Premium subscribers. This is a 50/50 revenue share model where you earn up to $5/month per Premium subscriber (launching this week). What I'm looking for: - Proven user acquisition experience, especially in B2C SaaS - Understanding of developer/tech professional communities - Self-directed approach to growth strategies - Ability to drive conversions to paid subscriptions This is a true partnership opportunity - no salary, pure performance-based revenue share. Full autonomy in your growth approach. If you build a base of 1,000 users, that's $5k/month recurring. I'm committed to responding to all applicants. Email muz11@victorantos.com with examples of your growth work and your approach for MUZ11.
