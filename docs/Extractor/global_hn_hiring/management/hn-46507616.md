Thunder Compute, YC S24 | https://www.thundercompute.com | In-person in San Francisco Hiring 4 full-time Software Engineers for low-level C++ systems work (HFT skillset preferred), reporting to the CTO, team from Citadel Securities, Aquatic, Old Mission, Bain We're a cloud provider using GPU virtualization software to arbitrage GPU prices. We research technology to use GPUs more efficiently than competitors. Our cloud network attaches GPUs over TCP to eliminate downtime. This lets us buy GPU compute, make it more efficient, and resell it at 60%+ profit margins. We recently closed ~$4.5M of funding to recruit the world's best low-level talent. If you're cracked at building C++ systems software and looking to do something more meaningful than creating liquidity in the market, reach out. To apply: email met at carl@thundercompute.com and mention HN. I read every email.
