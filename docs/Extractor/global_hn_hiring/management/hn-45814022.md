## 原始內容

Class Central | Educator / Subject Matter Expert (YouTube) | Part-time | Remote | [ https://www.classcentral.com ]( https://www.classcentral.com ) I'm looking for experienced educators, industry practitioners, and subject matter experts who want to teach live workshops on YouTube. We're launching an experiment: grow our YouTube channel by focusing only on intermediate-to-advanced topics. Class Central helps tens of millions of learners find the best courses. Small team (6 people), profitable, independent, 13+ years. This is genuinely experimental. You plan and lead live workshops on subjects you know deeply. Any domain works. We promote them to our audience, and we figure out together what clicks. I would like to skip the content farm tactics and beginner stuff. I just want to offer solid teaching for people ready to learn challenging subjects. careers@classcentral.com
