SEEKING GROWTH PARTNER | Growth | ActorDo
Not a job, but can be one. Exploring alignment.

I’m building ActorDo, an AI work assistant that actually helps people get work done. Email, calendar, tasks, context. Product is live. Users are using it.

Now I’m looking for a growth partner, not a tactic executor. With experience on US market.

This is about:
- positioning and narrative
- real distribution wedges
- fast experiments and feedback loops

Close to product. Close to users. No fluff.

Looking for a self-driven growth marketer who likes early-stage chaos, thinks in systems, and wants real ownership.

If this clicks, let’s talk. Must provide references.
