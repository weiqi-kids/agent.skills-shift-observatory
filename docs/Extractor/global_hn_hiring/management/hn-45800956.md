Goblins | https://goblinsapp.com | Founding Engineer #3 | Williamsburg, New York | ONSITE | $100-200k (+ generous equity) In education, we have always traded off scale and quality. In a 30-student math class, half of kids are ready to accelerate while half are still working on their foundational skills, but teachers cannot be in 30 places at once, giving each student one-on-one support. Until now. Imagine 30 teachers in every classroom—that's how Goblins feels. Students draw math on any device, and our AI figures out the "why" behind their confusion, giving instant feedback and building conceptual foundations. (Try it out here! https://app.goblinsapp.com/onboard ) Goblins launched to school districts in the spring of 2025. Since then we've built a waitlist of thousands of teachers and sold Goblins to districts across the US (we'll hit 100k+ paid students this year!). We are in the unique position of having a product that is both highly differentiated and demanded :) Technical problems that we find interesting: → Building knowledge graphs that adapt to student performance in real-time, routing them to the optimal next problem they should solve to maximize learning and engagement. → Extending our handwriting recognition from digital canvas to real paper through Chromebook cameras (think real-time OCR on math equations through low-quality webcams with poor lighting) → Creating interactive mathematical lessons (think 3blue1brown, but conversational) that remediate student misconceptions. You'll be joining founding team members Sawyer (CEO, former Head of Design at X1 [acquired by Robinhood] and math teacher) and Alp (CTO, ex-Stripe and Amazon), plus two other exceptional founding engineers. We move fast, care deeply about craft, and obsess over delighting users. If you're interested, email alp@goblinsapp.com :)
