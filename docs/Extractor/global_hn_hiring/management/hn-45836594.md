Leadership Development – Strategic Partnership (Remote) Are you an established consultant or a retired executive with a network you're not ready to stop using? This isn't a job; it's a strategic partnership. We are Relationship Media, LLC, a leadership education company founded by a 20-year law enforcement veteran and former S.W.A.T. commander. We have a proven, "sticky" training program that solves the single biggest problem in organizations today: The Relationship Gap. We’re not selling abstract theory. We sell a practical, example-driven blueprint for leadership (using our proprietary "Be Like Tony & Don't Be Like Chad" framework) that helps organizations in public service, manufacturing, and healthcare solve their $223 billion crisis of cultural disconnection. We have the product. We're looking for partners who have the relationships. The Opportunity: Two Ways to Earn We are recruiting a small team of commission-based partners to bring this vital training to their networks. 1. The Certified Partner (White-Label): This is for independent consultants, coaches, and trainers. We will white-label our entire online course with your brand, logo, and welcome video. It becomes your product. You sell it to your clients and keep a significant portion of the revenue. Stop trading your time for money and add a scalable, recurring income stream to your practice. 2. The Affiliate Partner (Referral-Based): This is for retired executives and well-connected professionals. You make high-level introductions to your network (City Managers, Police/Fire Chiefs, Plant Managers, HR VPs). When we close a deal for in-person or online training, you earn a generous referral commission. You leverage your credibility; we do the rest. Who We Are Looking For: • Profile 1: The Independent Consultant. You are an HR, OD, or leadership consultant, etc., looking for a proven, high-quality curriculum to sell to your existing clients. • Profile 2: The "Encore Career" Executive. You are a retired/semi-retired leader (e.g., City Manager, Police/Fire Chief, HR Director, Operations VP, etc.) who wants to leverage your network for a flexible, lucrative, and meaningful opportunity. This is a 100% commission-based partnership for established professionals who understand that their relationships are their most valuable asset. If you are a high-level connector ready to monetize your network by solving a real-world problem, we want to talk to you. Lean more/apply at: http://partnership.relationshipmedia.net/
