## 原始內容

Comper | First Product Designer / UI Engineer | €80-100k + equity | Utrecht, The Netherlands | ONSITE | https://comper.io We make software landscapes understandable and explorable. Our canvas is zoom-to-code, and shows data on overlays from all of the git repos in your company. LLMs go through the codebase and extract the architecture. We provide clarity when it's most needed: re-orgs, onboarding, explaining the tech stack at board meetings. Or just being stuck in your IDE and want to ask your team mate a question. Comper needs someone that can design revolutionary UIs and go where no man has gone before. I don't know exactly what to call this role, as it crosses several disciplines: Design, Engineering, new UIs. Our UI is the core of our product: a zoomable canvas that has all your code, documentation and diagrams on it. We have a long way ahead and need serious thinking to make sure we explain the software stack as simple as can be. I'm the founder & CTO. We just raised a pre-seed and are now with 4 people. Find the vacancy on our site and send us an email. Site is a bit outdated as it's not prio #1. Happy to chat.
