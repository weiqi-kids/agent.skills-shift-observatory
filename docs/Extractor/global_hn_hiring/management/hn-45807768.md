## 原始內容

SPREAD | https://www.spread.ai/ | Technical writer & support | Germany (Berlin, ideally) | Full-time SPREAD builds B2B software for mechatronics customers like cars and defense systems. We help them design, build and diagnose problems with their systems faster. We do it with a combination of a well-designed ontology we've spent years working on as well as AI-based systems. Right now, we're looking for a technical writer and also someone to start our support organization. Candidates must be in Germany already, though specific location within the country doesn't matter that much
