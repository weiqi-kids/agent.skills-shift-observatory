AREO | Remote (EU) | Full-Time | Equity | Roles: [Engineering Manager (Ruby on Rails), Lead Product Engineer (Ruby on Rails), Senior Android Developer]

My name is Marius and I am the CTO at AREO (https://goareo.com/).

AREO, founded in January 2023 by a team with 20+ years of combined experience in retail and startups, is a young startup specializing in developing innovative solutions for supermarkets and grocery retail stores. Our cutting-edge B2B SaaS platform optimizes workflows for employees by providing real-time access to inventory, product information, and customer inquiries. We serve large supermarket chains in Germany and across the EU.

About a year ago we brought a backend developer on board through "HN - Who is hiring" and are now seeking a Lead Product Engineer / Engineering Manager and a Senior Android Developer with a minimum of 8 years of experience (preferably in startups) as we just closed another 1M+ ARR contract with a major retail chain and are growing quickly.

For the Product Engineer / Engineering Manager (but not the Android Developer) role professional knowledge of German is highly preferred.

If you're passionate about building innovative retail products from scratch, these roles are for you.

Backend Stack: Ruby / Rails (8.x), StimulusJS / Hotwire / Turbo, AlpineJS, Postgres, Docker, DigitalOcean, OpenAPI, LLMs

Mobile Stack: Kotlin, Room, Jetpack Compose, Hilt
Perks: Fully remote roles (Europe), work where you are most productive, sizeable equity in a rapidly growing company, flat hierarchies, no-ego work environment, work in a lean but highly experienced team

Apply here: marius[at]goareo.com and mention “HN - Who is hiring?” and the role you are applying for in the subject.
