Language REACTOR

REMOTE mostly, but I travel often (Europe, Asia) and it's good to work in person time to time.

We make software for learning languages. The focus is on making tools, rather than content. But actually, the line between code and content is blurring with LLMs.

I am the main coder on the project and I'm looking for a coding partner to help spread the load and allow more ambitious scope. Project is solid financially.

Most of the codebase is fairly decent Typescript. Backend knowledge a plus.

I need someone with sound judgement and taste that can plan and execute independently, but that also can communicate and coordinate complex changes well. Ingenuity and resourcefulness.

I use Claude/Cursor extensively.

I'm quite interested to hear from you if you have a project that overlaps in scope with Language Reactor.
