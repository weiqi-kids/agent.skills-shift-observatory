## 原始內容

Magnetic | https://magnetictax.com | Multiple roles | San Francisco (ONSITE) | Full-time Magnetic (YC S25) is building the AI tax preparer for accounting firms. We use vision models to extract and structure data from tax documents and automatically populate legacy tax software, saving CPA firms hours of tedious data entry per tax return. Firms are coming to us faster than we can build - our next tax season is already 10x the size of October's, and we have a waitlist for several X more. We just raised a $5.1M seed round and are building a small, senior, in-person team. We believe in everyone talking directly to customers, and getting into the workflow themselves (i.e. learning how to do tax returns). We like to work together all day, whiteboard new ideas, get lunch together in person, and get drinks after work.
