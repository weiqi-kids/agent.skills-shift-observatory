## 原始內容

foam.ai | Founding Engineer | $180-$300k | 0.25%-2% | SF (onsite) | Full Time foam is building a new observability stack that captures, traces, and links everything, purpose-built for AI. We use this foundation to feed complete context into AI to automatically identify and root-cause breakages across entire systems. * We’re a five person team. Perla (CEO) was the 5th engineer in the consumer facing team at Affirm (pre-IPO). * We've raised $9.9M in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Max Levchin, The House Fund, and South Park Commons * We’ve got active betas at Orb, Braintrust, Plaid & TogetherAI. We’re looking for engineers who want to take point and work hand in hand with Perla on one or more of our core systems: 1. The Telemetry Engine - Think of this as a major extension of OTEL custom built to capture signals that have historically been inaccessible to humans. 2. The Root Cause Analysis Engine (aka Solver) - This is currently an agent swarm, but evolves every week in search of better and better root cause analysis. For a bit more on the role, check out: https://foam.ai/careers If putting an end to awful on-calls and building a system that can deliver self-healing software is exciting to you, send an email to luke -at- foam dot ai with your resume and mention you came from HN.
