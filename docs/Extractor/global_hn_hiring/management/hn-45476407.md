EnergyHub | Engineering Manager, Staff Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer and more | Full-time | REMOTE (US)$130k-$195k

See all our open roles here: https://grnh.se/30f1ece22us

Want to work on helping to decarbonize the electric grid and transportation in the US? (the two biggest sectors for impact)

Want to do it at scale? (we control over 1.8 million devices across the US making up over 3 gigawatts of electrical load for utilities that service 1/3rd of the entire US population)

EnergyHub’s software makes it easy for millions of smart device owners to partner with their utility and help decarbonize the grid. Our platform lets consumers turn their smart thermostats, electric cars, EV chargers, batteries, and other products into virtual power plants that keep the grid stable and enable higher penetration of solar and wind power. We work on technology that already provides energy and cost savings to millions of people through partnerships with the leading companies in the Internet of Things.

All roles are remote but if you like offices we have them in Brooklyn, NY and Burlington, VT.

Note that we can NOT sponsor visas at this time.
