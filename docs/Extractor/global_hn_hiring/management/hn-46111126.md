Thunder Compute, YC S24 | https://www.thundercompute.com | In-person in San Francisco Hiring 4 full-time Software Engineers for low-level C++ systems work (HFT skillset), reporting to the CTO, team ex-Citadel, ex-Aquatic, ex-Bain We're a cloud provider using GPU virtualization software to arbitrage GPU prices. To our customers, we are a direct substitute for Runpod, Lambda, Coreweave, etc. with a simple UX and low prices. Our advantage is we have spent 3 years bringing research technology to market which lets us use each GPU more efficiently than competitors. We can buy GPU compute, make it more efficient, and resell it at 60%+ profit margins. We recently closed ~$4.5M of funding to triple our team size with a focus on recruiting the world's best low-level talent. If you're cracked at building C++ systems software, on noncompete and bored, or looking to do something more meaningful than creating liquidity (you can tell most of our team is from HFT), reach out. To apply: email met at carl@thundercompute.com and mention HN. I read every email.
