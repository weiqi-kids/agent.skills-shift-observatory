Neo.Tax | Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Remote (US Timezones) | Full-time

Neo.Tax is automating enterprise accounting and tax with AI. We help companies like Notion, Mercury, Brex, and Whoop calculate R&D tax credits and capitalize software costs in hours instead of weeks—saving millions in manual consulting fees. Our stack is TypeScript/Node.js/React/SQL with distributed data pipelines processing millions of records from Jira, GitHub, payroll systems, and accounting software.

We're hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to join our 7-person engineering team. You'll build our software capitalization product end-to-end—designing data ingestion pipelines, modeling flexible schemas for diverse customers, building integrations with third-party APIs, and shipping customer-facing features that finance teams use monthly.

What we're looking for:

- 7+ years full-stack experience with TypeScript, Node.js, React, SQL, and distributed systems
- Ownership mentality—you can take product requirements and break them into iterative deliverables that ship value quickly
- Comfortable with ambiguity and greenfield problems
- Strong fundamentals (we use AI as a multiplier, not a substitute for engineering skills)

*Why join now*: We're preparing for Series B with 2x YoY growth, multiple profitable months, and real product-market fit. You'd be joining at a stage where early employees have outsized impact on trajectory.

Salary: $190k–$210k + equity. Remote-first, but we prefer timezones that overlap with Mountain View, CA.
