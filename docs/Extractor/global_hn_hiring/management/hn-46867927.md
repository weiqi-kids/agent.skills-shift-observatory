Comper | Multiple roles (engineering + design) | €80-100k + equity | Utrecht, The Netherlands | ONSITE | https://comper.io

We make software landscapes understandable and explorable. Our canvas is zoom-to-code, and shows data on overlays from all of the git repos in your company. LLMs go through the codebase and extract the architecture.

We provide clarity when it's most needed: re-orgs, onboarding, explaining the tech stack at board meetings. Or just being stuck in your IDE and want to ask your team mate a question. We'd like to do to large org codebases what Figma did to design.

Comper needs someone that can build revolutionary UIs and go where no man has gone before. We are hiring a software engineer and a genius designer (with ideally some engineering prowess). Our UI is the core of our product: a zoomable canvas that has all your code, documentation and diagrams on it. We have a long way ahead and need serious thinking to make sure we explain the software stack as simple as can be.

I'm the founder & CTO. We just raised a pre-seed and are now with 5 people. Find the vacancies on our site and send us an email.
