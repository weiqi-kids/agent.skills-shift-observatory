Puma.tech | Remote-first with PST overlap | iOS/MacOS, Android, Ai/ML, Growth | https://puma.tech

Hi all, I’m Yuriy, founder of Puma.tech. Previously worked  as software engineer & developer advocate at Cloudant (YC S08, Acq. by IBM), Meteor (YC S11), Parse (YC S11, Facebook/Meta), and explored AI/ML (computer vision for self-driving cars).

We have two products:

1. Puma Browser (iOS & Android) – browser with built in LLMs & Wallets. Private by design.

2. PumaAI app for Mac – ChatGPT/Atlas, but with ability to pick different model providers and fall-back to local-first ones for data privacy.

Open Roles: Eng (iOS/MacOS, Android, Ai/ML, Browser Extensions), Based Social Media Intern; Internships: Eng, Design, Growth

We’ve raised a few rounds from some of the best builders in crypto and ai:

Protocol Labs (YC S14), Chris Larsen (Ripple), Anatoly Yakovenko (Solana), Illia Polosukhin (NEAR Protocol), Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake CEO, Neeva, Greylock), Jason Warner (poolside.ai, ex-GitHub CTO), Don Ho (Orange DAO, Quantstamp W18), Evil Rabbit (Vercel), John Phamous (SF Compute) and other amazing builders.

How to Apply: email careers+hn [at] puma.tech with your GitHub, a note on what you're most proud of building and what you'd like to build next.

Thank you!
