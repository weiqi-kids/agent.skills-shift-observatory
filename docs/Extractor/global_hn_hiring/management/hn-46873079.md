company: "Evercred (Pre-A stage)"
position: "Remote (US)"
location: "Technical Co-Founder - AI Agent Infrastructure"
category: "management"
remote_friendly: true
salary_range: "$20K/mo + up to 20% equity
We're building AI agents that reduce physician credentialing from 90 days to 14 days. $50B market, healthcare orgs desperate for this solution.

THE ROLE: You'd own agent orchestration, monitoring, and ML operations as founding technical leader. We have agents built by external agency launching in 2-4 weeks. You'd evaluate their implementation, build operational infrastructure, and own the technical strategy as we scale from 0 → thousands of verifications monthly.

THE OPPORTUNITY: - 20% equity (founding team level, 4-year vest) - $20K/month cash (adjustable based on equity preference) - Clear path to Series A: $1M ARR by summer 2025 - Own agent infrastructure for industry-disrupting product - Work directly with CEO/CPO, high autonomy

THE REALITY: - 3-4 month runway (aggressive growth targets) - Remote/async-first, US-based for timezone overlap - Paid trial week ($1,400) - mutual evaluation for partnership - Need production ML/agent experience - Must move fast intelligently (AI-assisted development expected)

THE TRIAL: Week 1: Evaluate third-party agent code, build monitoring infrastructure, or pivot to corrective strategy if code needs work. Testing judgment + execution + communication.

LOOKING FOR: - Production experience with LLM agents or ML systems - Can leverage AI tools (Claude/Cursor) to accelerate safely - Comfortable with ambiguity, short runway, high ownership - Wants equity upside, sees potential in healthcare transformation - CTO-level strategic thinking

NOT A FIT IF: - Need structured W2 role with benefits - Want low-risk established company - Optimizing for maximum cash vs. equity potential - Need multiple approval layers for decisions

TO APPLY: Email mark@evercred.com with: 1. Your approach to the trial problem (3-5 sentences) 2. Why 20% equity interests you vs. full cash 3. How you'd use AI tools to accelerate the week

We respond within 24 hours. Strong candidates start immediately.
