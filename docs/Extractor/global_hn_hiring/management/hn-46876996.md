Wolf Games is looking for a U.S.-based, fully remote Software Engineer (3+ yrs experience) to help turn creative game prototypes into polished, production-ready web games. You’ll work hands-on in TypeScript and modern web game frameworks (Phaser, Pixi.js, Three.js), building gameplay systems, improving performance, and helping ship new experiences to players. This role is ideal for an engineer who enjoys moving from experimentation to execution and wants to see their work go live.

You’ll collaborate closely with engineering, design, and creative teammates to refine features, refactor early code, and contribute to shared systems that support multiple games. We’re a small, fast-moving team, so you’ll have real ownership, practical mentorship, and the chance to grow your skills while building interactive games in a creative, AI-forward environment.

$45-55/hour, 40 hours per week, contract-to-hire (benefits and equity at conversion)
