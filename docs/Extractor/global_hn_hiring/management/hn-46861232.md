New Lantern | https://newlantern.ai | Software engineers (frontend and backend product engineers) | Full time in San Francisco, CA (ONSITE)

New Lantern is building an AI radiology resident—think Cursor for radiologists. Our application integrates the three software tools radiologists use all day [1], together with AI, to create a platform that saves radiologists toil and lets them focus on reading images and finding disease.

We are a series A startup with ~15 engineers (~25 total staff), have live customers generating revenue, several years of runway, and are backed by Benchmark, Anthropic, and other great investors.

We're hiring for several engineering roles. You'll work directly with our founder/CEO, our staff radiologists, and our end users to build a product that radiologists rely on daily. You'll have real ownership and autonomy, and ship meaningful work frequently. Learn more and apply at https://careers.newlantern.ai

I'm Steve, New Lantern's Head of Engineering. If you're interested or want to learn more, shoot me a note at (my HN username)@newlantern.ai. I've already hired one engineer from HN this year!
