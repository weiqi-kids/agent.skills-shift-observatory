## 原始內容

MaFi Games | Senior SWE/Game dev | Contract preferred | Remote | C# Hi, I’m the co-founder of MaFi Games – an indie studio behind the game Captain of Industry. We are a small but passionate team who gave up their jobs at Google and Nvidia to pursue building the best factory simulation game possible, and we need more hands! We are looking for an experienced software engineer to grow the team and accelerate our progress. We strongly prefer candidates with a background in game development, experience with 3D graphics, and performance optimizations. Some reasons you’d enjoy working with us: * A multicultural, collaborative, and innovative work environment where your voice is heard. * Fully remote job with flexible working hours and vacation schedule. * Long-term full-time collaboration (not a fixed-term contract). * High quality C# code base, code reviews, tests. * High work satisfaction, work on a popular video game with a wonderful community. * No bureaucracy, 1 regular meeting per week. As an example of our technical work see https://www.captain-of-industry.com/post/cd-31 . We also have a unique signal-free train system: https://www.captain-of-industry.com/post/cd-46 If interested, please see the detailed info,requirements, and application instructions at https://www.captain-of-industry.com/jobs , thanks! Note: We are also looking for a 2D game UI/UX designer and a SFX artist.
