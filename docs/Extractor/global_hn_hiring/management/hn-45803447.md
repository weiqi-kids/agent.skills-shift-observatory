## 原始內容

Deep States LLC | Photon-pathway-simulation for analog 35mm movie-film emulation | Florida, U.S.A | Part-time | REMOTE or local. Deep States LLC is building the most realistic analog film-emulation system ever created. We're bringing back the classic 35mm film stocks that defined cinema in the 1980s. We're modelling photon-pathways on superchip systems; to simulate the sophisticated light-interactions between the layers in real film. We aim to perfectly digitally-replicate the unique photo-chemical properties of celluloid. We're looking for self-taught C programmers with wild-eyes and a thirst for breaking new ground. Can you perfectly model "Kodak Eastman Color Negative II 100T 5247" film stock on a rack of superchips? Let's find out. Contact us if you want to be part of the first team to crack-the-code of celluloid. We seek renegade coders who want to make a dent in the universe, and have the intellectual-firepower to deliver the holy-grail: Digitally modeling photon-pathway interactions in REAL analog film strata.
