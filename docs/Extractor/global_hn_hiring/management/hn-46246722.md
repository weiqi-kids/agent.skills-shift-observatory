## 原始內容

Senior / Staff Engineer @ Titan Actively adding engineers to our team led by Dave Schatz (early at Facebook with Zuck, built Gas with Nikita Bier (hit #1 in the App Store, later acquired by Discord) Titan is an award-winning wealth manager with a mission to increase our generation’s compound growth rate. We plan to do this by putting a human wealth advisor in every pocket. Historically, wealth managers have been accessible to only the ultra-wealthy. With Titan, they’re available to everyone. We harness frontier technologies like artificial intelligence to build a platform that gives advisors superpowers, enabling them to serve clients they historically never could. Backed by a16z, General Catalyst, Sam Altman, and many others, we manage over $1 billion in assets for clients across the country. https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/titan/0e65d04d-c32d-442d-9b99-d41e2...
