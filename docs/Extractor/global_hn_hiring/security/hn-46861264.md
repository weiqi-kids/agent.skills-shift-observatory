Tenzir | Software Engineering & Sales | Remote (EU Timezones) | Full-time

Tenzir is building an open-core security data pipeline for the AI era. We empower defenders to collect, shape, and route security telemetry at scale. Our stack relies on C++23/26 and Apache Arrow for the core engine, with a modern TypeScript platform layer.

We are hiring for 4 key technical roles to join our distributed team (HQ in Hamburg):

- Software Engineer (Core Engine): Systems programming with C++23/26. Work on our pipeline language, query execution, database integrations, and streaming data processing with Apache Arrow.

- Software Engineer (Product): Full-stack TypeScript/Python focus. Build the control plane, platform APIs, and developer tools, AI workflows, and anything else that makes our engine accessible.

- Account Executive: Our first dedicated AE to own the full enterprise sales cycle. You'll work with complex deals in security and data infrastructure.

- Solutions Engineer: Lead POCs and post-sales implementation. You'll be the hands-on engineer ensuring customers succeed with complex data pipelines.

We are a remote-first team across European timezones. If you like solving hard data problems, we'd love to hear from you.
