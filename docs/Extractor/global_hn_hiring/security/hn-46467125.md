## 原始內容

Tandem Health | Software Engineers | On-site in Stockholm, Sweden | Full time At Tandem Health we're building a clinician copilot to allow clinicians to focus on care rather than administration. We’re building, launching and iterating quickly, and are already rolling out across some of the largest care chains across Europe, including most of the NHS. Our first product listens in to the patient-clinician encounter to generate medical records, allowing clinicians to save 5-10 minutes per patient. No longer do clinicians have to catch up on administration after hours. We’re expanding our Stockholm team with exceptional engineers in a wide range of roles, from security to product.
