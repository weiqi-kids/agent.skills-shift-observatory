## 原始內容
Northstar Security | Software Engineer | SF Bay Area | Onsite | Full-time
Northstar is a seed-stage cybersecurity startup building an agentic platform to help security teams understand and defend the complex environments they're responsible for. Our semantic layer integrates data from the fragmented security and IT tools that teams have to deal with and allows for an AI-native approach to reasoning over a company's security posture.

We're looking for someone with hands on experience building modern AI systems who wants to join an early startup (<5 engineers) and everything that comes with it: working closely with design partners, solving hard technical problems, working in a fast-paced environment and figuring out how to apply agentic AI in practical, novel ways.

I'm also looking for someone who's a scrappy ui engineer/designer hybrid - will want to see examples of interesting UIs you've built and how you're using AI to accelerate the design process.

Contact me if you're interested - alex@northstar.security
