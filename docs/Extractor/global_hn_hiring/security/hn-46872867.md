• Write high-performance async Python (FastAPI, asyncio)

• Design and test resilient agent logic and microservices

• Operate and improve production systems with strong observability

What we’re looking for
• 5+ years of Python experience, including async web services

• Experience with FastAPI, testing, and CI/CD
