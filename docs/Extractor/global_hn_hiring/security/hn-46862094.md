DrSwarm is building AI-driven workflow automation for healthcare clinics / health systems (scheduling, RCM/billing workflows, patient ops). This is a true 0→1 role: ship fast, talk to customers, own systems end-to-end.

You will:
- Build product end-to-end (Next.js + Django)
- Ship integrations + workflow automation (APIs, webhooks, background jobs, queues)
- Own reliability (logs/metrics, retries, failure modes) and pragmatic security (HIPAA-aware)

Stack: Next.js, React/TypeScript, Django/Python, Postgres, Celery/Redis, Docker, AWS/DigitalOcean, LLM APIs.

Looking for:
- Strong full-stack builder who ships
- Good to work with
- Can talk to customers / users / salespeople
- High integrity, cares about healthcare

Comp: Market with mix of base + bonus + meaningful equity

Process: 30m intro → 60m technical/product deep dive → short paid work trial → references. I (founder) read every email and reply.

Contact: jobs@drswarm.com (include “HN Founding Engineer” in subject) + GitHub/LinkedIn + 2–3 projects you’re proud of.
