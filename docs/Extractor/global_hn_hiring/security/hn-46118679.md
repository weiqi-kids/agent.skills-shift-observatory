## 原始內容

Common Prefix – Software Engineers / Auditors – Greece – Remote – Full-Time Common Prefix is a science-first blockchain consulting company. Our vision is to make blockchains usable for mainstream users and everyday people – paying at the supermarket, remittances, moving money across borders, saving, investing – and solving the real problems of usability, scalability, and interoperability that come with it. We're a 30-person team, half scientists (cryptographer PhDs, post-docs, and professors) from renowned universities, half engineers with long web2 experience. A lot of our field is broken and we're trying to make a small contribution in fixing it, by introducing provable security and proper engineering practices across the board. What we're looking for: Software engineers who can solve problems, are smart, get things done, and enjoy working on the bleeding edge, learning about cryptography, and working from first-principles. Auditors who can write and read code, especially low-level cryptographic implementation code (zero knowledge verifiers, signature schemes, etc), consensus (PoW, PoS), or smart contracts (everything DeFi). Tech stack: Doesn't matter, we'll teach you. But we work mostly with Rust. Open roles: * Software Engineer, https://commonprefix.notion.site/sw-folk * Auditor, https://commonprefix.notion.site/auditing-folk We offer: - $80,000–$160,000 / year cash - Local from Athens, Greece, or remote, preferably in Europe - Conference participation in exciting scientific and engineering venues, 2-3 times per year - The opportunity to work and learn from world-class scientists from major universities in the field of blockchains, cryptography, and consensus If you're interested in joining our team, apply here: https://commonprefix.notion.site/2b7bf672de828051b53cdd37811...
