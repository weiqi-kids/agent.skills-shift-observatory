Fusionbox | Python + TypeScript Engineers | United States| Full-time | REMOTE (Legal to work in the US)

We're a software engineering consultancy that builds enterprise software the right way. We negotiate the right to open source all our client code, maintain a handful of popular libraries, and our engineers contribute to Django core. We sponsor PyCon, DjangoCon, and Django Girls because we're invested in the ecosystem we build on.

We're looking for software engineers who value software design, system architecture, and collaboration. You should be comfortable with about half of these areas and eager to learn the rest: web application security, relational database design (PostgreSQL, beyond "SELECT *..."), Django internals, React, and distributed systems. What you'll actually work on: complex state machines for financial workflows, multi-tenant architectures with row-level security, custom database functions when the ORM isn't enough, and React frontends that handle real-time data without being a mess of useEffect hooks.

We're a small team where you'll own features end-to-end (database design to React components) and have opportunities to shape technical decisions. You'll get paid to write source code with a team that practices empathy and values work-life balance. If you've ever wished your job involved more elegant state machines and fewer marketing landing pages, let's talk: info@fusionbox.com.
