About us:

The physical world is still largely unstructured. Quidient is building a new foundational category: Generalized (5D) Scene Reconstruction (GSR). Our API-first platform turns real-world environments into measurable, queryable digital assets—powering applications across defense, infrastructure, and spatial AI.

We work at the intersection of AI, physics-informed models, large scene/world models, and real-time 3D systems.

Open Roles:
- Software Engineer, Full Stack (Product / Web) • Build polished web + desktop interfaces on top of our 5D reconstruction engine, including interactive 3D workflows and API-driven experiences.

- iOS Engineer (Opening Next Week) (Mobile / 3D / AR) • Build high-performance iOS applications for real-world capture and reconstruction using Swift, Metal, ARKit, and CoreML in compute-heavy, low-latency environments.

- Senior SDET (iOS / Performance / Automation) • Own quality and release readiness for iOS edge applications, leading automation, CI/CD, and deep performance profiling across CPU/GPU/memory/thermal constraints.

- IT Systems Administrator • Build and scale internal IT for a deep-tech company, supporting cloud identity, MDM, security posture, GPU-heavy engineering systems, and compliance-driven environments.

- Technical Project Manager (Product Development) • Keep complex, cross-disciplinary engineering work moving—owning sprint operations, roadmap hygiene, stakeholder alignment, and execution clarity alongside engineering leadership.

Team & Setup:
Small, senior team. Real customers. Real physics. Hybrid roles based out of our Columbia, MD technology center. Company is profitable and doubling this year.
