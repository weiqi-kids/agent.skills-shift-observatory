Oxidian | https://www.oxidian.com | Remote (Ireland/EU ONLY) We're doing to government software what challenger banks did to banking. We build critical systems that help scientists and researchers, ensuring public money is well invested. Our work involves building high-performance Python libraries to wrangle massive earth observation and satellite data sets (think petabyte scale), creating clean web UIs for complex data, and building modern DevOps pipelines to automate scientific workflows. We're a small, fast-moving team. We give you trust and autonomy to own your work from day one. No bureaucracy, just hard problems and impact. We're hiring: * Senior Python Developer (solve complex data and performance challenges) * Senior DevOps + Python Engineer (build the infrastructure that runs it all) More info and how to apply: https://www.oxidian.com/#join-us
