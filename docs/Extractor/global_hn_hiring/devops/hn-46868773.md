We are looking for a Fullstack Engineer and AI enthusiast to join our engineering team.

We are rebuilding the core tool stack of the legal industry from the ground up.
Lawyers still work in workflows designed decades ago: fragmented tools, manual reviews, static templates, and compliance processes that don’t scale. We think that’s unacceptable in an AI-first world.

This job is for you if you:

Love building from 0 to 1 and validating ideas quickly.
Have a fullstack skillset, enjoying collaborating across the stack.
Used to leveraging AI to code and most of your code is written with AI.
Are curious about AI integration (e.g., LangChain, Azure LLMs) and want to push boundaries.
Prefer startup speed over corporate processes.

Only apply if you've been heavily leveraging AI to code - our team moves at lightning speed.

apply here and show us the project you're most proud of: https://join.com/companies/casusch/15584391?
