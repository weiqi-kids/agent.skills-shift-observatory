AIRMO is a European climate-tech company using space and airborne technologies to monitor greenhouse gas emissions globally. Our instruments — combining LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging — detect and quantify methane and CO₂ emissions from industrial sites, pipelines, and national infrastructure.

We’re building a global monitoring system from air to space, helping energy companies, governments, and investors take real action on climate impact.

We are hiring a frontend, fullstack and an ML engineer in our new Luxembourg office.

You must be located in Luxembourg, or be willing to relocate.
