Cleric | Staff SWE, AI | Staff SWE, Product | Head of Marketing | SF Onsite | $160K-$240K + Equity Engineers can't keep up with their production environments: dozens of services, dashboards everywhere, alerts firing. The information to diagnose most issues exists, but finding it takes longer than fixing the problem. AI generated code is making this worse. Cleric is an AI SRE that autonomously investigates production issues and surfaces findings to engineers. It connects to your existing tools, reasons through the evidence, and tells you what's wrong. We believe engineers should ultimately be accountable in production, and our goal is to help them go much faster. The hard part is making agents reliable when there's no single right answer. We've built evals, memory systems, and feedback loops that improve with every incident. Gartner just named us a Cool Vendor, we are well funded with years of runway, and most importantly the engineers that use our product find it very sticky. We're hiring the following roles: - Staff SWE, AI: Build the reasoning engine. Design evals, debug agent behavior (not just code), expand what it can handle. You've built agents and operated distributed systems at scale. - Staff SWE, Product: Define what AI SRE should be. Spend time with engineers during incidents, find gaps, decide what to build. You've owned products and know production pain. - Head of Marketing: Engineers love the product but we need to reach more of them. Software engineers are allergic to AI hype, and you'll need to cut through it. Technical background required.
