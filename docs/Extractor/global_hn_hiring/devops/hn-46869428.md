Bookarang (part of NBD Biblion) is using AI to build tomorrow's book recommendation technology. Book retailers and libraries use our technology to provide their readers with truly relevant and personal recommendations — not on the basis of popularity or other people’s behaviour, but by using the book’s content and the reader’s personal preferences as a starting point.

As a DevOps/backend developer, you'll ensure our technology runs smoothly across test and production environments, from in-house R&D servers to services used by schools and libraries nationwide. You'll handle monitoring, profiling, and designing scalable, robust solutions using technologies like Airflow, Grafana, Prometheus, Docker, MongoDB, and MySQL. We're exploring Infrastructure as Code, Ansible, and new data engineering and database systems, and we're curious how you could contribute to these transitions.
