## 原始內容

ParadeDB | https://paradedb.com | SF Onsite + Remote | Full-Time | Rust Database Engineers ParadeDB is an alternative to Elasticsearch built on Postgres. We're building a Postgres extension in Rust that offers a new index type optimized for full-text search and aggregate/analytics workloads. We solve three problems with Elasticsearch today: - Lack of read-after-writes guarantees - Lack of JOINs - Infrastructure complexity & cost due to syncing Postgres and Elastic. We're open-source, and our repository is available at https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb . We're a Series A team of 8 distributed across the US and Canada. Most folks on our team have 10+ years of experience in database internals at companies like Twitter, MongoDB, Oracle, Instacart, etc. You can find our roles and the profiles of our team members here: https://paradedb.notion.site If you know Rust and/or have experience working on DB internals and want to work on cool systems problems, shoot us a note. We hire with conviction, have lots of room to grow, and exciting technical problems to solve. My email is phil@paradedb.com.
