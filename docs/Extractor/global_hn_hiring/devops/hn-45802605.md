Thunder Compute, YC S24 | https://www.thundercompute.com | In-person in San Francisco Hiring ~6 full-time Software Engineers across C++ systems and Kubernetes infrastructure Find JDs here: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/thunder-compute/jobs We're a GPU cloud building software to use GPUs more efficiently. To our customers, we are a direct substitute for Runpod, Lambda, Coreweave, etc. with a simpler UX and lower prices. Our advantage is software - we have spent 3 years bringing research technology to market which lets us use each GPU more efficiently than competitors. At the same time, our software focus lets us provide a high-quality, industry-leading UX. In a space where customers shop around and try several providers, having a better product at lower prices has let us quickly expand. We recently closed ~$4.5M of funding to triple our team size and continue building best-in-class software. If you're cracked at building C++ systems software (most of our team came from HFT) or kubernetes infrastructure, reach out. To apply: email met at carl@thundercompute.com and mention HN to guarantee I see your application.
