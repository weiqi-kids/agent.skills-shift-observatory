## 原始內容

I’m looking for someone with deep expertise in both machine learning systems and quality and test automation. The right person will have hands-on experience validating model correctness, reproducibility, and performance, ideally using PyTorch or similar frameworks.

This isn’t a typical SDET role. We’re specifically looking for someone who understands ML infrastructure and model-level quality. Candidates with experience limited to traditional frameworks like Playwright or Selenium won’t be a fit.
