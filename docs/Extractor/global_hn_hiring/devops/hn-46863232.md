Immunera | Principal Machine Learning Engineer | NYC area (hybrid) | Full-time | immunera.ai

Hey! I’m Maxim, cofounder/CEO of Immunera.

We're building blood tests that use gene sequencing and machine learning to help patients with autoimmune disease. Immunera spun out of years of research at Stanford, and our technology has been published in Science and covered by The New York Times.

We're hiring a Principal Machine Learning Engineer to shape the core models and infrastructure that power our blood tests. We are partnering with hospitals to generate training data from real patients for our language models and other biological sequence models.

This is a senior engineering role with significant autonomy at an early-stage, venture-backed startup. We're looking for strong experience building and operating ML systems in production (Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, cloud platforms). Prior biology or healthcare experience is NOT required; we care much more about your ability to reason about data, models, and systems.
