## 原始內容

Deep Kernel Labs (DKL) | Senior DevOps Engineer | REMOTE (Spain) | Full-time | €45-65K | https://dkl.digital Hi, CTO/co-founder of DKL here. We are a multi-disciplinary team leveraging analytics and Artificial Intelligence, both generative and more traditional, to help a global client-base in the energy space solve complex problems and build systems that turn Data and AI into measurable business value. DKL is a 30-strong, fully-remote 2.5yo company built around a 10yo core team where owners are all active engineers and whose growth is funded by its own revenue. We are looking for a DevOps engineer who will work with our teams and leadership to define and implement solutions that are architected with the right balance between feature-set, cost, scalability, security, maintainability and tech debt in mind. We have established a strong cloud-based baseline tooling ecosystem that we need to keep improving while we diversify to less vendor-locked alternatives and different efficiency profiles. Find out more details about stack, skillset and the streamlined selection process at https://dkl.digital/join-us/sr-devops-engineer/ We strongly believe in growth within (and beyond) a role so do not be put off if you think your profile does not yet match some of the listed points. We are also happy to hear about why you think your value proposition exceeds the compensation bracket mentionned above. Feel free to reach out directly to me at hn.recruiting at if you have questions.
