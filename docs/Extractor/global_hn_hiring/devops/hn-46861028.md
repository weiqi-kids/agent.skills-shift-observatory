Realm.fun | Full-Stack Engineer | Remote (EU timezone preferred)

  Realm.fun is a game server hosting platform - think "Vercel for game servers." We make it dead simple to spin up Minecraft, Valheim, Palworld, and 25+ other game servers in seconds.

  Stack:
  - TypeScript, Astro 5 (SSR), Tailwind CSS
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL), Stripe
  - Docker, Kubernetes, Pelican Panel
  - Deployed on Hetzner Cloud

  What you'd work on:
  - Building the dashboard where players manage their servers
  - Real-time features (console, metrics, player lists)
  - Payment/subscription flows
  - Infrastructure automation (node provisioning, scaling)

  What we're looking for:
  - Strong TypeScript skills
  - Experience with either frontend (React/Astro) or backend (Node/PostgreSQL)
  - Comfortable with infrastructure (Docker, K8s is a plus)
  - Bonus: You've actually hosted or played on game servers

  Small team, early stage, lots of ownership. We're bootstrapped and profitable.
