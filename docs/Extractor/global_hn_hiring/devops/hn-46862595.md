Hike Medical | Boston (ONSITE) | Senior+ Software Engineer

Hike Medical is reinventing musculoskeletal care, starting with feet. Our proprietary AI-vision platform turns a 30 second web based (yes, no sensors) foot scan into precision engineered, 3D-printed insoles that prevent pain before it starts. We're already protecting on-their-feet workforces at Fortune 50 leaders, major health systems, and middle America manufacturers. Fresh off a stealthy round with top tier VCs, we run a fast, no BS, execution first culture out of Boston’s Seaport as we sprint toward $100M ARR and standing with 10M Americans as they step into their shoes daily.
