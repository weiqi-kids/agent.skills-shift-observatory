We're looking for a: - Cloud Infrastructure/Data/MLOps Engineer to work on our ML recommendation systems, but you'll probably get the opportunity to work on other data systems and the rest of our ML platform as well. The team pretty great, lots of collaboration and no egos. If you like video games or tabletop games you'll fit right in. Your stack would probably include a lot of GCP (BigQuery, GCS, ...), K8s, Airflow, datastores (Redis, BigTable, etc.) and Python.
