ClickHouse | Senior Software Engineer - Distributed Systems / Cloud Data Infrastructure / Kubernetes | Remote US remote preferred right now, EU is technically fine but I'm looking to ramp up in US atm ClickHouse is a popular, Open-Source OLAP Database. We are ClickHouse Inc, the company behind the database aiming to build the best in class real time data warehouse. What we are looking for: Distributed Systems / Cloud Engineers to build the AutoScaling Systems for a Cloud Database. We also maintain our own ClickHouse-based Data Infrastructure. Bonus points if you've worked on auto-scaling or other data-driven forecasting challenges in the past. Can work in an early stage startup environment. Proactive and hands on. You must be independent and self-organised. Good at Go, Kubernetes (Understanding how to manage stateful services in a multi-cloud environment) We have a Python service in our Recommendation pipeline, so some ML/Data Science knowledge would be good. SQL / ClickHouse SQL (goes without saying) You'll need to be able to do On-Call - debugging production infra or db issues If you can do low-level database programming (C++, ClickHouse) that's added bonus. If you want to work on operating production critical databases in the cloud on k8s + write data-driven algorithms for autoscaling, consider applying! Send me an email: manish.gill [at] clickhouse [dot] com [0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFoMsLMZKik [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufY_JFPpzRI PS: If you're a pure DevOps person or a pure Data Engineer who wrangles data tools, please read the above requirements carefully before firing off an email. This role is an intersection of a lot of sub-roles, not a particular specialization.
