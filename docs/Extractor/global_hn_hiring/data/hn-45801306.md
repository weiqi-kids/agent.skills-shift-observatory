## 原始內容

HouseAccount | https://www.houseaccount.com/ | AI Engineer | Full-time or Part-time | Remote only (Eastern Time USA) Say you have a broken pipe, a door to replace, a TV to mount. How easily can you find a handyman to get it done? At HouseAccount we want to harness the power of AI to improve the home services space. Currently we integrate with OpenAI Platform to ask follow-up questions so handymen can get a thorough description of the issue and provide a quote right away. I am looking to hire a developer to make this integration even smarter, anything from image recognition to recommender systems. I am the sole developer and I'm looking to be joined by someone autonomous and with a lot of energy. You will be responsible for tinkering with existing LLM models (how to rewrite the prompt to balance tokens and speed?) and for coming up with your own innovative solutions (can a homeowner take a picture of a broken pipe and get an instant quote and availability?). We are a startup, which means you will work autonomously and you will own the pipeline without any "corporation bureaucracy". Your task is to build something innovative where the outcome speaks for itself. If this sounds like you, submit your application to https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/houseaccount/jobs/495978200... Written communication skills are paramount so a cover letter is expected. Include "HackerNews" to get screening priority. Thanks.
