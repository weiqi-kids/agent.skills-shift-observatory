We've built an AI agent that users can invite into group conversations to make planning, coordination, and information retrieval effortless.

Try adding our agent at http://continua.ai/ to group chats and kick the tires! https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/google-vet-raises-8m-for-c... I’m David ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpetrou/ ), the founder and CEO. Before starting Continua, I was a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google. We’re backed by top-tier VCs (like GV) and incredible angel investors (like Jeff Dean). Our team is a fantastic bunch ( http://continua.ai/team ) of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Disney, and several AI startups. We're pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people. We’re hiring systems and ML engineers: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/continua/ You'll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is, including fine-tuning models to boost conversational quality and improve scalability and identifying novel ways to build a "memory" which leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users.
