## 原始內容

Wallaroo.ai | Senior / Principal / Staff AI/ML Engineer | REMOTE (US-hours) | Full-time Howdy, y'all! I am the VP of Technology here at Wallaroo.AI and I am looking to grow our team with a few more folks who are really skilled at deploying AI models and enjoy getting to work with some of the latest accelerator hardware available. Our core mission is to automate the entire deployment lifecycle for AI models — on any hardware platform. This involves automating the packaging, compilation, deployment, and optimization steps necessary to ensure models run efficiently. Our platform allows users to target different hardware simply by changing a line of Python and rerunning the process. To achieve this, we need people who deeply understand the complexities of AI model deployment and inference so that we can automate it across a wide variety of hardware platforms. We are a series-A startup that has been fully distributed from the beginning -- we hire the best talent wherever you are. If you think your skills align with our mission and you like working on high visibility projects with a fast-paced team, please get in touch! https://wallarooai.applytojob.com/apply
