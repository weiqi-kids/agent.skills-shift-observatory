## 原始內容

StrongDM | [Staff, Senior, Junior] AI Agent Engineer | San Francisco Bay Area (Palo Alto) | Full-Time | ONSITE

StrongDM applies deep tech to hard problems for demanding cybersecurity customers. Our embrace of large language models continues that tradition, achieving useful and reliable outputs from ambiguous and non-deterministic inputs.

Join me (Justin, co-founder & CTO) and our newly-formed AI Agent team to help our global customers secure their most critical systems.

Ideally: if you've already decided you need to be working on the edge of this technology wave & you're open to doing so in person at a physical whiteboard, e-mail me a few words to that effect (justin@strongdm.com).
