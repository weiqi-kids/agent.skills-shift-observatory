SightlineOS | NYC (Hybrid) | Senior Data Engineer, Senior Full Stack Engineer | Full-time

Hey HN, this is Louis, co-founder at SightlineOS.

Yusha, Derrick, and I are building an AI-native supply chain operating system for restaurant chains. It’s a massive, overlooked space with deeply underutilized data, and we’re using modern data and ML systems to automate planning, inventory management, and spend optimization.

We’re venture-backed, NYC-based, and are hiring our first senior engineers as we start to scale. These are high-ownership roles with real production impact from day one.

You’d work closely with founders, own core systems end to end, and help shape the technical foundation of the company. Depending on the role, you’ll either own and scale the data foundations that power our ML and customer insights, or ship end-to-end product features that directly impact how customers operate day to day.

Location: NYC (hybrid, 3 days/week in office)  
Salary: $135,000 - $185,000, role-dependent + equity
