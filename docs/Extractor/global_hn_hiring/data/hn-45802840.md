Elicit | San Francisco + remote (US timezones) | https://elicit.com/careers Elicit is building AI for science. We scaled to >$7MM annual revenue and 450k MAU fast. We're hiring for multiple roles and are primarily interested in people with early-stage company experience, who are comfortable in high-agency, fast-paced teams. Reasons you might want to join Elicit: 1. We have been thinking about how to apply AI for high-stakes knowledge work since even before GPT-1. Elicit was spun-out from Ought ( https://ought.org/ ) which was an applied research lab. 2. If you're concerned about the potential downsides and risks of super-powerful AI: so are we! Happy to explain more of this story on a call, or you can also check e.g. https://ought.org/updates/2022-04-06-process for a primer. 3. We like spending time with each other, and have get-togethers every 6 weeks, but we're flexible on location. Reasons you might not want to join Elicit: 1. We've found a level of product market fit (as evidenced by metrics) but we've not proven everything out yet. If you want predictability, Elicit is not for you. 2. We aim to hire people who thrive in low-bureaucracy environments, and let them loose. If you need structure, lots of support, close mentorship, or tightly-defined work assignments, Elicit is not for you.
