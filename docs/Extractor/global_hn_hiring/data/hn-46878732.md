Verge is transforming drug discovery by using artificial intelligence and proprietary human data to solve the biggest driver of rising drug costs: high clinical failure rates. To achieve this, we have built one of the field’s largest corpuses of multi-modal patient molecular and clinical data, sourced directly from human tissue. Our team of engineers, neuroscientists, and biologists have so far delivered two drugs to clinic, discovered 282 new targets, and signed commercial partnerships worth in excess of $1.6B with Eli Lily and AstraZeneca.

We are hiring across engineering and computational biology. All roles are fully remote, but we are only considering applicants based in the United States -- with extant permission to work here (sorry, no visa sponsorships right now).
