## 原始內容

Stealth | Software/AI Engineer | Remote Anywhere | Full Time Hello, I am bootstrapping an AI companion startup. I believe that within 10 years, more people will date AI than humans. I think this is neither good nor bad, just interesting, and I want to build something in this space. I am looking to hire someone with strong technical and problem solving skills. You will be seeing a lot of problems for the first time and need to just figure out how to hack a solution. Sometimes that involves writing code but not always. It is ok if you don't have prior AI experience. Interesting problems we will work on: - extreme latency issues while providing a fully multimodal experience (audio, video, text) - building models that predict when to interrupt in a conversation - building models and control systems for emotion - generating avatar response in real time - custom 3d models from input image - real time or very fast video generation with custom characters - llm memory As I am bootstrapping this, I can only offer up to $4,000/mo ($50,000/yr) at the moment. If you are interested, please email James at gcyiuqy1 [at] gmail.com
