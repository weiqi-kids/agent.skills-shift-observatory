daydream | San Francisco (Onsite) | Full-Time

daydream is an AI-native growth marketing company helping some of the fastest-growing teams use AI to drive sustainable, measurable growth. We’re building systems that sit at the intersection of applied AI, SEO/GEO, experimentation, and revenue; with real production impact, not demos.

We’re growing our technical and growth leadership team and are currently hiring for the following roles:

Applied AI Engineer

Work hands-on with LLMs, retrieval systems, and applied ML to ship production AI features. You’ll collaborate closely with engineering, growth, and product to design systems that move real business metrics; not just model benchmarks.

Staff Engineer

A senior IC role focused on technical leadership, architecture, and setting a high bar for engineering quality. You’ll partner with founders and senior leaders, own critical systems, and help scale both our platform and our team.

Growth Lead

Own growth strategy end-to-end, from experimentation and SEO/GEO to AI-driven insights and execution. This is a hands-on leadership role for someone who can think strategically, execute tactically, and partner deeply with product and engineering.

If you’re excited about building at the intersection of AI, engineering, and growth, and want to work on problems that actually ship, I’d love to hear from you.
