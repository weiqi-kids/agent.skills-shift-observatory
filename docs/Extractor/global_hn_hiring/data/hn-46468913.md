Quantum Rise | Chicago or NYC (preferred), Remote for the right candidate | Full-time | No visa sponsorship | https://www.quantumrise.com/ Quantum Rise is an AI-forward consulting startup serving the middle market, across multiple industries. Clearly many companies are struggling to understand how to leverage artificial intelligence in their day-to-day operations, to understand what their existing workforce now needs to know, or to understand whether they're about to be disrupted. Many have business problems which "traditional" machine learning could help with even before the current GenAI hype cycle, but for whatever reason hadn't prioritized doing so until now. We try and help getting a handle around these issues and designing outcome-driven solutions. Agentic AI Solutions Manager: You'll work directly with clients to benchmark, train and deploy agentic systems for industry-specific problems. We're looking for someone deeply curious about agentic systems across vendors and platforms. Companies are looking for ways to leverage agentic systems to upskill their practitioners. This is a front-facing development role for someone who loves both tech and tackling real business problems. To apply, send me an email at julian.berman at quantumrise.com, mentioning HN and including your CV. Data Engineer: You'll work directly with clients and application developers to design and build data solutions for AI-enabled applications, Lakehouses, Warehouses, and analytics that solve industry-specific problems. We're looking for someone passionate about delivering outcomes that combine best practices for deterministic data management and governance with AI functionality across tools, vendors, and platforms. Our clients need to leverage AI to solve specific problems using data. This is a client-facing development role for someone who loves to work with data technologies and tackle real business issues through genuine innovation. To apply, send John an email at john.swift at quantumrise.com, mentioning DE and including your resume/CV.
