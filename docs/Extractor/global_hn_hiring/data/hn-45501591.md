Canvas (The Spatial Computing Company) | Full-time | Remote

At Canvas, we’re working on spatial computing - using computer vision to 3D reconstruct and understand your surroundings so that software can operate over real-world spaces. We believe it will power the next generation of augmented reality and some of the key parts of virtual reality as well.

Our most pressing open position right now is a Data Lead (tech lead level data engineer/analytics leader) - Globally Remote, but preferred somewhere between GMT-4 and GMT+2 for overlap with US and EU.
