## 原始內容

9 Mothers Defense | Robotics / Data Scientist | Austin TX | Full-time | ONSITE We're building AI-driven turrets that stop hostile drones - where robotics needs F1-level speed. We're looking for smart, T-shaped teammates: people who are experts in one area but happy to jump in wherever needed. Our software team is small, so every member makes a real impact. If you want to write motor control in Zig, optimize camera processing with custom CUDA kernels on Jetson, or rework a transformer-based tracker to handle small objects - you can do that here, and much more. US persons only Send your CV, GitHub (or any publicly visible project), and a short note to jobs@9mothers.com
