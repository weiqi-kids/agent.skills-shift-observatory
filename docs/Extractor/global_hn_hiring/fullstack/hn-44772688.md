Hi, I am the founder of Rappo (agentic GTM Chief of Staff). We observed that technical startups spend way too much time in the early stages figuring out GTM.

Everyone says early PMF is crucial, but there is no streamlined support there.

PS: I am a solo founder, and we allocated generous equity for advisors and early hires.
