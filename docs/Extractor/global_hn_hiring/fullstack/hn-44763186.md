Prophet Town LLC | Full-Stack Software Engineer; also, Sales and Marketing | REMOTE (US) and Hybrid | English fluency required | Full-time | $150K-$250K annual total comp (multiple)

I’m the founder, trying to do “enlightened business.” We are a people-first, fully-remote, boutique indie tech agency – building a team of talented, high integrity, and community-minded individuals first, then building businesses around them. Our leadership staff are ex-Fortune 100; everybody touches code. Notable recent projects: internal tools for Anduril, and voltagepark.com.

Engineers:

We are looking for Full-Stack Software Engineers with proficiency in some or all of: React, Python, Ruby on Rails, Database Design, Devops, and third-party API integrations. Tier3 roles are typically 5-10 y/o/e with $150-$175k annual total comp. Tier4 roles are 11-20 y/o/e, $210-$250k annual total comp. Higher tiers exist, and we welcome exceptional applications.

Please apply using this Google Form: https://forms.gle/2LnPAcqQYWbthddb6.  Applicants who submit before August 15 will receive a reply by August 22.

Sales:

I am continuing to seek one or two unique business-/sales-/marketing-minded individuals - probably former tech startup founders - to work with me personally on formalizing and expanding our sales efforts.  Understand our unique inventory of talent, help me find problems worth solving for the staff, and pitch bespoke solution proposals that make potential clients take notice.  Please send me a pitch, including your preferred pay band and/or comp strategy: hn-sales-rfp@ptown.tech
