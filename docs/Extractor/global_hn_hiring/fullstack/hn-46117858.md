## 原始內容

Twing.AI | AI/Full-Stack Engineer & Forward Deployed Engineer | Remote (US-friendly timezones) or NYC | Full-time or Part-time We’re a lean (4 people, 3 of which are engineers), bootstrapped team building a private-equity automation platform (deal analysis, document processing, chat, investment theme research). Shipping fast, learning daily, and looking for hands-on engineers who want outsized impact. - Stack: React Router 7/React 19, shadcn/Tailwind v4, Node/TypeScript (strict), PostgreSQL + Prisma + pgvector, S3; AI workflows with embeddings & LLMs. - Why join: small team with direct ownership of core product, zero bureaucracy, Greenfield decisions and ability to learn extremely quickly, you’ll ship to paying users weekly. AI / Full-Stack Engineer - Own features end-to-end: data ingestion → AI pipelines → UI. - Design and tune LLM/embedding flows; keep latency/cost in check. - Requirements: strong TypeScript/Node, modern React, SQL + data modeling; comfort evaluating/using AI models; bias to ship. Forward Deployed Engineer - Work directly with customers (PE analysts/partners) to turn messy workflows into productized features. - Rapidly prototype, measure impact, harden for production. - Requirements: full-stack chops, great product sense, calm under ambiguity, willing to jump between code, data, and customer calls. Happy to also talk to the self-taught. We care more about ability than credentials and value slope over intercept. How to apply: Email jobs@twing.ai with “HN – [Role]” in the subject, a short note on something you’ve shipped, and any links (GitHub/portfolio). No recruiters.
