Lovable | Multiple Roles | ONSITE | https://lovable.dev

At Lovable, we empower the 99% of people who can't code to build software as if they had a product team at a stellar tech company. We're one of the world's fastest growing startups in history.

You'd be joining a small, passionate team of serial entrepreneurs (ex-YC founders), competitive programmers, physicists, and people who care deeply about building exceptional products that unlock human creativity.

We have multiple open roles, with most positions based onsite. We cover relocation (most roles are in Stockholm) and in Engineering we're looking for:

- AI research engineers, including a Research Engineering Lead

- Full-stack, frontend, and backend product engineers

- Security engineers

- Data engineers

- Platform engineers

We're also hiring in Growth (Product Marketing Manager, Community Lead, Communications, PR), Operations (Technical Talent Lead, CEO Office), and Design (Product Designers who ship, Design Engineers).
