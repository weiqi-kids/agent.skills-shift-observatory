Y Combinator | Dogpatch, San Francisco, CA | Full-time, In Person | https://www.ycombinator.com

YC has been building ever-more ambitious software for founders to succeed -- since Garry returned. In the last year, our team delivered:

* Safe tools that has processed $1B+ in seed funding in last 4 batches

* Fundraising CRM for founders manage their fundraise -- used by all founders

* Work at a Startup has 1M+ candidates on it, with 1000s of hires/year

There are ton of ways we see YC Software benefitting our alumni and investors -- and we want founder/founding engineer minded people to drive each into standalone products.

Yet in reality, we're a team of 14 full-stack product engineers, the company is 85 people, and we intend to stay small and scrappy. I was the 7th engineer at salesforce and loved the early stage, and we get to be that way at YC... indefinitely.

YC is also knee-deep in applying AI tools and techniques across all of our product surface areas, and investor-focused work is no exception. We’re happy to share more when we chat in person.

We also want to work with people who love building full stack web apps. While our stack is Rails, React and Postgres, mostly we’re just a bunch of pragmatic builders who are excited about shipping and having impact.

Two roles are posted below: Investor Software and Post Batch (all SW after the batch).

If you're interested, read more below and email me directy with what you'd be excited to build here: ryan@ycombinator.com.
