iGent AI | Senior/Staff Engineers | London, UK (Hybrid, 3 days/week) | Full-time | https://igent.ai

Hi! Co-founder of iGent AI here. We build agentic systems for large-scale, industrial projects, and an agentic cloud.

Proof: our agent built a Redis-compatible database in Rust, with no human coding, in 70 man-hours – see https://www.igent.ai/insights/production-database-server

Why join:

* Small, senior team: ex-DeepMind, OpenAI, Microsoft Research, Amazon, and Cambridge University

* Hard problems across distributed systems, OS/sandboxing, ML and LLM inference/post‑training. Real users; ship to prod.

* Big Tech salary + options.

Open roles (all Senior/Staff; hands-on):

  • Full-Stack - design and build the new agentic interface, with top designer

  • Agent Infrastructure - branching sandboxes, filesystems, orchestration, observability

  • Backend / Eng Lead - build cloud from first principles; distribution, sync, load-balancing, events

  • LLM inference & post-training - long context tech, RL, vLLM, performance

  • Devrel & GTM – live-developing, tutorials, OSS/community, hackathons - drive adoption

You might be a fit if you have:

- 5+ years building and operating production systems (or exceptional evidence).

- Own 0→1 projects; comfortable reading & generating lots of code.

- Public work (OSS/papers/blogs/products) or strong portfolio.
