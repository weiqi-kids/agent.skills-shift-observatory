Continua AI | https://continua.ai | Multiple Roles | ONSITE (NYC/Seattle) | Full-time | Salary + Equity

At Continua (http://continua.ai/), we're on our way to solving Social AI, and we're expanding our team! We've built an AI agent that users can invite into group conversations to make planning, coordination, and information retrieval effortless. We're social creatures and it just seemed to us a huge opportunity to bring AI into group settings. We've seen strong retention over the last few months and want you to help us bring our product to the next level. Try adding our agent at http://continua.ai/ to group chats and kick the tires!

I’m David (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpetrou/), the founder and CEO. Before starting Continua, I was a Distinguished Software Engineer at Google. We’re backed by top-tier VCs and incredible angel investors. Our team is a fantastic bunch (http://continua.ai/team) of accomplished engineers and researchers from Google, Slack, Disney, and several AI startups. We're pretty clued in on the technology side and have a strong vision of how the transformative technology of the last few years along with our own secret sauce (not just a ChatGPT wrapper) can help a huge number of people.

We’re hiring a Senior/Staff Machine Learning Engineer, a full-stack engineer, a systems engineer, and a content creator: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/continua/

For the ML role: you'll work on building and improving the best LLM group chat experience there is, including fine-tuning models to boost conversational quality and improve scalability and identifying novel ways to build a "memory" which leads to a personalized and unique experience for our users. You're an experienced machine learning engineer with broad knowledge and skills and have experience fine-tuning LLMs for both generative and discriminative use cases. You have a Master's or PhD in Machine Learning (or a Bachelor’s with exceptional industry experience). You understand what it means to work at a fast-moving startup.

Oh, and we maintain a vibrant blog, including items of technical interest, at http://blog.continua.ai/. Check it out! :)

David
