## 原始內容

Class Central | Senior Full Stack Engineer | Remote | https://www.classcentral.com

I'm looking for a senior engineer to take ownership (from me) of Class Central's codebase and infrastructure.

We help tens of millions of learners find the best courses on any subject. Small team (6 people), profitable, independent, and around for 13+ years. No VC drama, just sustainable growth.

Stack: PHP 8+, Symfony 7+, MySQL, Elasticsearch, Google Cloud. We keep it simple and productive.

Own the full stack, help shape our product, and build pragmatic solutions for our current scale.  I am looking for product-minded engineers who are focused on user experience and driven to understand the business.

I'm building a new cross-functional product team from scratch (engineering, product, design). Looking for a foundational engineer who can mentor, collaborate, and help define how we work together.

Remote-first, async, very few meetings. Real autonomy, real impact. Fair warning: being fully remote means no annual Halloween Heists.

While I don't have a formal job post up yet, if you're at that point where this feels like the right next step, I'd be happy to hear from you: careers@classcentral.com
