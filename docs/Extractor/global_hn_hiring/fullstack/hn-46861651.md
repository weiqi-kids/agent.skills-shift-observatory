Mozart AI | 2 Full-Stack Engineers (FE-leaning + BE-leaning) | London, UK | ONSITE (central London) / Hybrid | Full-time

Mozart AI is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with built-in AI Co-Production. We empower what we call the ‘Hybrid Musician’, an artist driven by human creativity and assisted by AI. You could say we want people to become “vibe musicians”.

We started around 8 months ago, have 80k+ beta users, and have been Product Hunt’s Product of the Day twice. Seed-stage (oversubscribed, will be announced soon) with meaningful equity for every role.

We’re hiring 2 engineers:

Full-Stack Engineer (Frontend-leaning): product UI/UX, React, Zustand, realtime-ish creative workflows, making the browser feel like a native studio

Full-Stack Engineer (Backend-leaning): platform + APIs + data and db design, reliability + performance, supporting fast product iteration

What you’ll like here:

Small team, high ownership, ship fast (by choice, you feel the urgency to change music creation)

Working on generative audio + creative tooling (hard but really fun problems)
