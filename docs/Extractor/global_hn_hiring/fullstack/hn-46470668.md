Positron | Bootstrapping Startup | South Korea | Co-founder Equity-only co-founders. If you must take a salary position, send us a resume with "Salary only" and we'll check back later. We're developing an efficient social-decision model so that communities can organize social-finance campaigns and effectively administrate funds without being beholden to one creator. Keeping funds in the hands of backers creates accountability and is one key to taking social finance to the next level. We say that our social tech "makes the money smarter." It will do this by making communities smarter. How we do social will change how every future social platform gets built and will upset every social product on the market. Society will benefit tremendously from the more coherent discourse. To bootstrap our platform, we are developing an music visualizer called MuTate. It will soon be powered by our in-house machine learning tricks, which do not rely on back-propagation in order to enable radical forward architectures that are smaller and easier to develop and train. This work directly impacts our mission and aligns us both with consumer enthusiasm for small & local AI to run outside the cloud and with people working on hard problems that need AI tool-kits they can embed their own world models within. We are using PrizeForge as a better kind of Patreon while we finish our crowd cognition implementation and start to integrate social decisions with our existing social finance. Our entire tech stack is Rust where possible. We use Leptos, Axum, Postgres with SQLx. It's like a full-stack typescript setup, but with Rust and WASM. MuTate uses Rust, the Vulkan API, and Slang. Anyone who materially accelerates the trajectory of the company will participate proportionately in the rewards. Our work on MuTate will put us default-viable. Our work on crowd cognition and community-organized campaigns will likewise make use default-viable. Prototype two-dimensional fund raising: https://prizeforge.com Career listings with more details: https://positron.solutions/careers MuTate Github repo: github.com/positron-solutions/mutate Korean language skill is optional but anticipate learning business Korean and translating a lot. Same timezone is as far as will be considered remote unless you're physically stuck in Ukraine etc and begin by contributing on MuTate.
