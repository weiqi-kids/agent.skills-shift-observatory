Ploid AI | Barcelona, Spain | HYBRID (preferably on-site) | Founding Engineers | Full-time + Equity

We’re building an AI-first bioinformatics platform to empower plant breeders and life science researchers with agentic AI and LLMs. Backed by pre-seed funding and real demand from biotech and seed companies, we’re looking for versatile founding engineers to help us shape the future of AI in genomics.

What you’ll do:

• Architect and build AI workflows, agentic interfaces, and data pipelines

• Work across the stack: Go, Python, TypeScript

• Contribute to system design, infrastructure (AWS, Docker, Terraform), and devops

• Collaborate closely with scientists and iterate from prototype to product

• Help define our technical culture and roadmap as a core founding member

Nice-to-haves (not all required): LLM integration, RAG systems, gRPC, scientific computing, cloud/on-prem hybrid systems

About us: We’re an early team of engineers and scientists with strong academic and industry backgrounds (ex-BCG, PhD in Plant Biotech, M.Sc. AI). We’re committed to building something impactful, technical, and genuinely useful for life science.

Apply: hello@ploid.ai
