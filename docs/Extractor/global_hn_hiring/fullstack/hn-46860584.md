Atomscale | Software Engineer, Full Stack | Boston, MA (Hybrid Onsite) | https://atomscale.ai

Atomscale is building AI to improve atomic-scale materials manufacturing. Our goal is to help translate new materials into new technologies and products by making sure they can be created at scale instead of stalling at R&D.

This is a hard (but exciting!) challenge that involves high-throughput data ingestion and processing pipelines, complex data visualization, and hardware integrations for direct control. The payoff is unlocking new technologies that address today's most pressing challenges.

⎯

We're looking for a Product-oriented Software Engineer that will:

- Build ergonomic interfaces for data visualization, workflow automation, and AI-copilot assistance.

- Develop backend systems with flexible, expressive data models and performant APIs.

- Create desktop apps for on-premises low-latency data streaming and hardware integrations.

(You don't need background in materials science!)
