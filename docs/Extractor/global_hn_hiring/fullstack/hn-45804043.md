This year, we've been focusing on RL environments and agentic workflows to help our clients ship agents that interact with the world. Here are some examples of our past work: - Creating the GSM8K dataset: https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/how-we-built-it-openais-gsm8k-da... - Collecting RLHF data for Anthropic's Claude: https://www.surgehq.ai/case-studies/anthropic-claude-surgeai...

We're looking for senior engineers to work out of our offices in SF or NYC, or remotely. Please reach out to us at careers@surgehq.ai with a resume and 2-3 sentences describing your interest. Excited to hear from you!
