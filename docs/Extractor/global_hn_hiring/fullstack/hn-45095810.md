eventfirst | Senior Full-Stack Engineer | Berlin, Germany | REMOTE (CET) | Full-time

We are applying AI to organize corporate events.

We are looking for a senior engineer with at least five years of full stack experience, a strong focus on product and UX, and optionally some experience building LLM based products. Currently we are focussed on building tooling that enables us to capture domain knowledge from experts to streamline prompt creation and evaluation.
Our tech stack is Typescript, React, Next.js and Tailwind. On the backend we use Drizzle with Neon, deployed and monitored via Vercel.
We have pre-seed funding from a major US VC and are experienced founders. You’ll be working alongside the founders (ex-Apple, ex-Airbnb, ex-Tulip, ex-Tourlane) and will have a chance to shape the company, product and of course the engineering culture.
