## 原始內容

CodeGrade | Full-Stack Software Engineer | Amsterdam (Hybrid) or Remote (Europe & Asia) | Full-Time | https://codegrade.com

We're building the all-in-one platform for coding education, born from our own frustration as TAs. At CodeGrade, students learn, code (optionally in a browser-based editor with full Jupyter support), and get feedback in one place. We're a small, bootstrapped, profitable, and distributed team looking for a full-stack engineer to help us own and build features end-to-end.

You'll be working with a high-impact team on interesting challenges in a product used by thousands of students globally.

Our Stack: Python (Flask), TypeScript, Vue.js, AWS.
