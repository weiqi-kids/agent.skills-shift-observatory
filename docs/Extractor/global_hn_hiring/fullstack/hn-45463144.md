Absinthe Labs | Full-Stack Engineer | REMOTE / NYC Hybrid | Full-Time

About us:
Absinthe is building the most sophisticated gamification engine for crypto-native incentive programs. Since 2022, our products have reached 50M+ visits and 2M+ active users. We’re a 10 person, well-funded team shipping fast.

The problem we’re solving:
Tracking per-user activity across DeFi protocols sounds simple but is surprisingly hard. Want to know how long someone held an LP position, or which users provided liquidity for more than 30 days? That data is on-chain but can’t be efficiently queried today.

We built an indexing framework that turns protocol events into time-weighted balances and point-in-time actions. Adapters map protocol-specific semantics (Uniswap ≠ Aave ≠ Morpho) into a unified model. The engine handles state, TWAP pricing, and exporting data anywhere. With ~100 lines of adapter code, you can track user balances and contributions at a fidelity no one else supports.

Why it matters:
This infrastructure underpins analytics, loyalty, and incentive programs across Web3. We see the Absinthe Adapter Library becoming the default developer layer for embedded finance.

The role:
We’re hiring a Full-Stack Engineer to own features end-to-end schema design, wiring GraphQL, polished frontends, and deployment. Our stack: Next.js, Hasura, dbt, MotherDuck/DuckDB, GraphQL, and in-house Web3 indexing. See open positions here: absinthe.network/careers#open-positions
