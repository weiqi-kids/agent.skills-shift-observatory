## 原始內容

Norm is building AI that understands regulations for regulatory compliance. Our AI currently automates compliance determinations for federally regulated financial content, though our vision is to build a platform that can handle any regulation in any industry. As AI begins to permeate our society, Norm aims to become a critical building block for other AI systems that need regulatory intelligence. You can read more about our vision here: https://www.norm.ai/post/building-regulatory-ai-agents

We've raised $87m from top-tier investors to pursue this vision. We're growing very quickly and have major, household-name financial institutions as clients and investors. We're working on hard, interesting problems and want to push the boundaries of what's possible for AI-driven products. We're hiring for many engineering roles, including:

- Full Stack Engineer, all levels ($150k-250k)

- Senior Design Engineer ($200-250k)

- Staff Frontend Engineer ($200-250k)

- Applied AI Research Engineer ($200k-250k)

- Cloud Infrastructure Engineer ($175k-250k)

- Full Stack Deployment Engineer ($150k-250k)

We're also hiring for many non-technical roles. The best way to apply is online on our website (we review every application!). Full list here: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/norm-ai?utm_source=7mlXgo3wAq.
