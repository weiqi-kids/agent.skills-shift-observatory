This is multi-modal AI in the real world, not a demo. ⸻ We’re looking for product-minded engineers who want to push the boundaries of generative AI, RAG, and intelligent automation. You’ll ship fast, solve real user problems, and help us make AI feel magical, not clunky. Tech stack: TypeScript, NestJS, React, React Native, AWS. Bonus: AI experience, but what matters most is product intuition and the drive to build useful things. Apply here: https://forms.gle/5fww8HDwRrP6c6Fo9
