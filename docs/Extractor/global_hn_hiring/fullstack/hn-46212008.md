## 原始內容

Alfie.io by xpflow | Remote (US) - East coast timezone preferred | Founding Full-Stack Engineer | https://alfie.io Alfie.io builds AI-powered tools that help small and mid-sized e-commerce brands reach new customers who are already interested in their products. We automate outreach, rankings, and discovery of affiliates, creators and ambassadors using LLM-driven workflows. The team is small and experienced, and we move quickly. I'm looking for an experienced full stack engineer to join the team - the right candidate will have a large degree of freedom in building the product, but plenty of support to get up and running. Our current stack is Typescript, Next.js, vercel, but we're actively looking at options for some of the more data intensive workflows. Real world experience with AI coding agents a must.
