## 原始內容

BuildBetter | Senior Engineer (Backend, Full-stack) | Full-Time | Remote (US) | 170-200k base + equity | Visa Sponsorship not provided BuildBetter is the product operations platform for customer-led teams. We've built an AI-first product that lets our customers, like Rappi, n8n, and Posthog, automate the operations work that lets them provide their customers with world-class product experiences. We're looking for two senior engineers to join the team; our headcount has remained small while growing revenue, and we're now bottlenecked by development speed in a way that will make you invaluable. You'll have real ownership over your code from product ideation to customer support, and we'll be making substantive product updates weekly. We're looking for team players who are as fun to work with as they are productive, and are willing to compensate these two rolls commensurately - our aim is to be in the 95th percentile of equity compensation, and we expect that in exchange we'll have value-aligned employees who will help us grow the business. Joining us will mean solving hard problems at the frontier of AI adoption, including: - maintaining performance at scale - building and maintaining rich frontend user experiences that maintain the standards of usability and delight that our customers know us for. - building agent and workflow systems that automate real work for customers - playing around with the latest models to figure out new experiences that we can offer our customers as cutting-edge models get released monthly - building automation that's grounded in supporting product teams rather than automating them - our bet is that this is the likelier outcome out of the current generation of AI systems Stack: Postgres / TS (Nest + React) / Hasura / EKS / S3 / LLM APIs / Python Benefits: - unlimited PTO - $100/mo education stipend - flexible hours: we measure productivity in terms of outcomes, not time, so as long as you're able to stay aligned, productive, and in regular communication, we don't really care what hours you work - health insurance ALSO LOOKING FOR: Senior Product Designer | $105k - $180k USD | Design + code in HTML & CSS (Tailwind) For engineering roles, please reach out at: nikhil (at) buildbetter (dot) app For the designer role, please reach out at: adam (at) buildbetter (dot) app
