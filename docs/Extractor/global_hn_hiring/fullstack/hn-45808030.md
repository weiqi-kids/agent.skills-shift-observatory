From the way our products look and feel to how we communicate and present ourselves in culture, we believe technology should evoke a sense of emotion. We created an icon with Phone (1) and changed the over-ear market with Headphone (1). Now working on a new form factor for the AI era. We are looking for exceptional, high-agency Full-Stack engineers who are passionate about using AI to build the future of consumer electronics! Have a look: https://careers.nothing.tech/
