## 原始內容

Surge AI (https://surgehq.ai/careers) | Software Engineers (full-stack / product https://surgeai.notion.site/Product-Engineer-4211688ff99b46d...) and Strategic Project Lead (https://surgeai.notion.site/Strategic-Projects-Lead-Generati...) | Full-time | ONSITE SF or NYC Hybrid

Our mission at Surge is to build the human infrastructure behind the next wave of AI and LLMs. We operate a data platform that powers AI teams at OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, and more. This year, we've been focusing on RL environments and agentic workflows to help our clients ship agents that interact with the world. Here are some examples of our past work:

- Creating the GSM8K dataset: https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/how-we-built-it-openais-gsm8k-da...

- Collecting RLHF data for Anthropic's Claude: https://www.surgehq.ai/case-studies/anthropic-claude-surgeai...

You’d be joining a rapidly growing team of former engineering and ML leaders from Google, Meta, Twitter, and Airbnb. We work in small groups, ship quickly, and value autonomy and ownership. No previous AI experience is required, if you have the engineering skills you can learn what you need on the job.

We're looking for senior engineers to work out of our offices in SF or NYC, or remotely. Please reach out to us at careers@surgehq.ai with a resume and 2-3 sentences describing your interest. Excited to hear from you!
