We'll do that by building the world's first completely generalized AI-powered learning platform. Today, so much of our focus is spent on making machines smarter. At Oboe, we believe it’s time for machines to make humans smarter. We’re a small but mighty team made up of builders who love learning, being challenged, and changing the world. If that kind of job appeals to you, we should talk. We’re looking for a Full-Stack Engineer to work across Oboe’s technology stack, from our backend pipelines that leverage AI to generate world-class content, all the way to the interfaces that our users use to engage with that content on the web. We’re a team of generalists, so this job will have you learning every part of the systems and features that bring Oboe to life. This is a highly hands-on role where you’ll have tremendous impact, ship real features to real users, iterate quickly, and learn a ton. Hybrid (3 days/week in office in NYC). Great benefits and unlimited PTO. Apply via the link above.
