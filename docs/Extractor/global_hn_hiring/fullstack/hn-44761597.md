Thoreon Research AI | Founding Engineer | Remote (US-based only) | Full-time | Competitive Base + Equity

Thoreon Research is an early-stage startup on a mission to revolutionize the clinical research industry. The process of bringing new treatments to patients is slow, complex, and expensive. We believe that intelligent AI agents can fundamentally reshape this landscape, accelerating development and significantly reducing costs. We are a small, nimble team of industry experts and are looking for a passionate and autonomous engineer to help build the core of our product and be a part of an exciting new company.

As a founding member of our technical team, you will have major ownership over the design, architecture, and execution of our core AI-based platform. We are seeking an AI and technology expert to help drive the technical vision and development of the product from the ground up. We will be moving fast together to quickly build a transformational platform. We're looking for a highly-motivated "builder" at heart—someone who is excited by a blank canvas and the opportunity to make a massive impact. If you are a product-minded engineer who wants to solve complex problems and build a category-defining and industry disrupting company, this role is for you.

We’re looking for
• 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a proven track record of building and shipping complex, full-stack applications.
• Deep familiarity with the modern AI landscape, including hands-on experience building with LLMs and a strong understanding of agentic frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, Autogen).
• A proactive, self-directed mentality. You are comfortable with ambiguity and thrive in a fast-paced, early-stage startup environment.

If you’re interesting in getting in on the ground floor with the opportunity to help set the technical direction of a groundbreaking Agentic platform contact: careers@thoreonresearchai.com
