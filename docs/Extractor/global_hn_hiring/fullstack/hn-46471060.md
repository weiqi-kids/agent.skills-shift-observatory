## 原始內容

MONUMENTAL | https://www.monumental.co/ | Amsterdam, The Netherlands | Full Time | Onsite We make robots that autonomously construct buildings. We are currently developing and manufacturing our autonomous bricklaying system in the beautiful centre of Amsterdam. And our robots are already earning real revenue operating on construction sites all over the Netherlands. We're looking for experienced software engineers for PLATFORM and FULL STACK who can help us solve problems like: - Data sync and analytics queries across a fleet of robots (that can be offline for hours at a time) - Rapid deployment and iteration of experimental software changes across firmware, control software and UI - Modelling buildings in code and finding the right UI for operators to edit them Check out the progress we've already made on Atrium, our operating system for robotics: https://www.monumental.co/atrium We're rapidly scaling up operations and we need experienced engineers who can build the systems that manage all of that complexity. If you think that 'full-stack' could reasonably mean debugging firmware, mixing buckets of mortar _and_ writing React components, we are looking for you. Robotics experience not required! https://www.monumental.co/jobs
