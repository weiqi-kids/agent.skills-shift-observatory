## 原始內容

px dynamics GmbH | Senior System Engineer, Full Stack | Full-time | Berlin/Cologne/Hybrid | https://www.pxdynamics.com/ Background: px dynamics was founded by me less than half a year ago, I have 15 years experience in short term power trading in European markets, esp. algo trading. I do some consulting to bootstrap the company with and build customer relations. Simultaenously, we're starting to build a product business. For that we have strengthened the team with a Senior ML Engineer (ex google) and a Head of Data with prior experience in setting up data pipelines in this domain. The products we build are in a broad sense trading signals, e.g. to help traders of renewable or flexible assets trade their positions better. Role: So given that it is pretty early days, we're of course looking for a broader skillset to lead the development especially of the cloud and backend infrastructure (hetzner), but eventually also frontend applications. Techstack so far is obviously minimal (linux, python, bash, postgres/timescale), so there is plenty of room to also shape this. What we as a team value is simplicity, really clean code/architectures, excellent documentations and quality over speed. So we're not trying to glue together the next venture to scam a bunch of VCs, but to really build something excellent. if that resonates with you, please reach out to me directly via the email address you'll find on our website.
