Tired of trying to beat kube into shape? Does writing YAML to ship code fill you with utter dread? Dream of a future where deploying software is simple, and you don't need an army of infrastructure engineers to build that perfect janky bash script™ to make life easy?

We're Railway, and we think infrastructure can be better. So far we've built out a platform loved by hundreds of thousands of users who simply tell us "Give me Postgres", "Deploy this repo", and we make it happen

Fair warning! The problems are complex: home-rolled hypervisors, cut-above container orchestration, over/under/whateverlay networks, virtio device drivers, edge proxies, IAM that doesn't suck, kitchen sinks - we need to build it and we're looking for likeminded individuals who think this stuff is fun.

Three open roles (apply below!):
