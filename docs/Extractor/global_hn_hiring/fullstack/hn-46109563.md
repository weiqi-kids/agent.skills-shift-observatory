## 原始內容

Turnstile ( https://turnstile.ai ) | REMOTE (US/Canada) | Fullstack Engineer (Tech Lead)| $190k-225k salary + equity --- We're a small (23-person) team of repeat founders and seasoned operators building a next-gen quote-to-cash platform. This is a tight-knit and senior crew — most of us have 10-25 years' experience, much of it together. The last company we built, Second Measure (YC S15), scaled to 70+ people and tens of millions in revenue, and was ultimately acquired by Bloomberg in a landmark deal. We've built a category-defining product and are now gearing up to scale. We're looking for a Tech Lead with early-stage startup experience to help architect our platform and mentor a small team of talented engineers. We're well-funded by top investors (First Round) and just raised our Series A, are fully distributed, and recognized for building intentional, inclusive culture. We offer competitive global rates (SF salary + equity), equal pay by level, and comprehensive, family-friendly benefits. I'm Mike, one of the founders— if interested, apply here ( https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/turnstile ) mention this post.
