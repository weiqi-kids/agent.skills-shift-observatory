Allied General | Northern Mexico  | REMOTE (Mexico) with frequent travel or ONSITE | Full time

-

Can you handle projects that seem unsexy and uncool but are actually incredibly gratifying and great businesses? Read on. We’re building software to help small manufacturing firms ($10 - $20MM in revenue) build things with higher quality and speed. Help us help small firms compete against the big guys by delivering manufacturing more consistently and with higher quality.

Three pilot customers/design partners to start working with, on both sides of the border.

The company is not VC backed and probably won’t be for a long time. Good wages, lots of work. Good people. Not a lot of bullshit.

Us: Highly technical founding team with track record of success. Tiny tech team, large manufacturing team.

You: True full-stack. You enjoy shipping features, not code. You keep things simple. The role is “founding engineer”: you must be ok with a tiny team and working mostly by yourself.

Stack: Elixir.
