Onton.com | Sr. Fullstack Engineers and Design Engineers | SF | Hybrid

Join us in pioneering the future of e-commerce search. 1M+ MAU growing rapidly. $10M+ raised from top-tier VCs and individuals with backgrounds from Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Stitch Fix, Whatnot, Stripe, and more.

We're a hard-working team of 6. We have a new office in Jackson Square with a great view that we're looking to fill with other high-performance people!

Tech-wise, it's React/Typescript + Julia, if that's interesting (no worries if you haven't used it). We've also built our own graph db to cope with the scale, and the foundations of a neuro-symbolic AI agent that learns more about the world on every search!
