Small, senior team – several ex-engineering directors turned ICs (mostly ex-early Cloudflare). Looking for staff-level engineers with experience building highly performant front-end apps. Stack: React/Typescript and MobX (MST) on the frontend, and Node/GraphQL across our backend. The challenge ahead: Scaling.
