## 原始內容

At CloudX ( https://cloudx.io ) we’re building a new supply-side advertising platform for mobile publishers. Yes, it's ads, and yes, there's AI involved, so stop reading here if that's not interesting to you. It's a gnarly infra problem with huge scale, combined with an interesting product space that we think legitimately benefits from tasteful AI automation. We're doing cool things with Nitro Enclaves to prove that our auctions are fair. And our founding team have done this before with great success, first at MoPub (sold to Twitter) and MAX (sold to AppLovin). We're hiring (all remote) for: - Senior Fullstack Engineer https://jobs.gem.com/cloudx/am9icG9zdDogum5THF3fORqb1eEupFQx - Senior Infrastructure Engineer https://jobs.gem.com/cloudx/am9icG9zdDo4vl4A1sEcc7sDQf8ZYiqR - Senior Android SDK Engineer https://jobs.gem.com/cloudx/am9icG9zdDqPAWu1cxr3PmEuuTIdliI6 - Senior iOS SDK Engineer https://jobs.gem.com/cloudx/am9icG9zdDpOy3Qmt1fLsOu4gKwtwWTz Our philosophy is to keep the team small, well-paid, and productive. We deploy every day and our monorepo CI suite takes about a minute to pass. The best way to apply is directly through those jobs pages but if you have other questions you're welcome to email me at peter@cloudx.io. I always post here on HN because it's where I got my career started back in highschool; I will personally make sure you get a response if you apply.
