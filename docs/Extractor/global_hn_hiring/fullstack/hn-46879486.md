We are building "Iron Man" for litigation. Our endgame is an AR application for smart glasses that gives lawyers real-time intelligence—flagging discrepancies and prompting objections during live trials. Before the glasses, we're shipping the brain: a desktop voice interface that gives lawyers "Jarvis-like" control over workflows (redlining, scheduling, billing).

The Role We are looking for a finisher to join our small engineering team in Downtown Santa Monica. We have a hard product launch on March 9th at a 6,000-person conference. The work is high-intensity (5.5 days/week) and high-impact. You will optimize voice-interface latency, build LLM workflows with LangChain, and own your code end-to-end.

Requirements

Stack: Go, Rust, and/or SolidJS (Production experience required).

LLM Native: Experience with model-agnostic architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), tool calling, and streaming.

Offer

$120k – $160k salary + significant equity (0.0% – 1.0%).

Seed stage ($2.3M raised).

Benefits: Free dental/vision/gym; Kaiser health plans (Bronze free, others subsidized).

Location: In-person, 3 blocks from the beach in Santa Monica.
