We're replacing outdated systems by combining the reliability of traditional trading infrastructure with cutting-edge technology. Our mission is to give collectors and investors the financial infrastructure they deserve. Why We’re Hiring a Full Stack Engineer: We need a full stack engineer to lead and own critical features end-to-end, making key technical decisions that define our platform. You will build, maintain, and scale our core backend, including the order matching / order-book logic—focusing on concurrency, correctness, and speed.
