Lantern | https://withlantern.com | Software Engineers (Python, Full-Stack) | Full time in New York, NY (ONSITE) Lantern is building AI-powered revenue intelligence—think autonomous agents that turn cold outreach into warm conversations. Our platform automatically detects buying signals across your tech stack [1], prioritizes opportunities, and helps B2B sales teams focus on deals that actually close. We're an agentic-first startup building with Python, FastAPI, Next.js, and React, backed by a modern data stack (Postgres, ElasticSearch, ClickHouse, DuckDB). We deploy on Kubernetes/AWS and use Temporal.io for workflow orchestration. We're hiring software engineers who want to work on cutting-edge AI and agentic systems. You'll translate complex customer needs into scalable architecture, optimize AI model efficiency through prompt engineering, and ship features that directly impact how revenue teams operate. We value ownership, bold ideas, and people who want to push boundaries. This role is based in our Manhattan office (4 days/week in-person). We offer full health and dental coverage. Apply here: https://forms.gle/kEi5MDDiaJKdyN3fA I'm Maksym. If you're excited about agentic AI and reshaping B2B sales, shoot me a note at maksym withlantern.com.
