## 原始內容

Positron is looking for co-founders.

∇ Full-stack Rust (Leptos & Axum)

∇ Based in Busan & Seoul

∇ Building a production finance model for open source: https://prizeforge.com

∇ Prototype works and tech is accelerating

You need to be prepared for the not-fun work of founding.  Prototypes lurk in every corner.  We know what engineering should look like and we do not complain when we are not looking at it.  We just build.  Founding can be extremely rewarding and I need to build out a team and put some equity into hands that will take care of it.  Our mission is extremely important.  We are making progress and will be growing.  People with enough vision to commit to this train will be taken care of.

I am all for ample vacations and flexible hours.  This company has the right shape to offer those things in the future.  Right now, it's about grit and who wants a shot at doing something risky with a lot of payoff.  If the market isn't going to give you the career advancement, high-risk opportunities, or compensation you want, you are welcome to try to make this your ticket as well as mine.
