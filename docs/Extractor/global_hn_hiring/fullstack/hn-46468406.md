## 原始內容

Blackbird | Dev Shop | Remote (US or Europe) | Contract Blackbird builds web + mobile apps for startups and innovative companies. We work on interesting, greenfield projects, and rely on small, veteran teams who have lots of autonomy. Everyone is a remote contractor, and our work culture is low-drama and highly collaborative. No pointless meetings, no bureaucracy, no egos and lots of time spent building things. We’re looking for senior full stack engineers / CTO consultants / data scientists. We value engineers who are strong technically as well as great communicators. We work with lots of freelancers who appreciate the steady, interesting work. Our typical stack is TypeScript, React, Postgres, and AWS although it will vary project to project. If you enjoy moving fast, working with great engineers, and building something from the ground up, you’ll fit right in. If interested, reach out directly to me at vance [at] blackbird.us
