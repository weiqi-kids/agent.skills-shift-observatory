Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Full stack web and AI | San Francisco | Onsite | Fulltime

YC itself hires software engineers from time to time.  Many people don't know that YC has a small but very important software team.  We run several websites - not just this one, but also workatastartup.com (the main way YC companies hire), a social network for YC founders, and the core infrastructure that YC itself runs on.

Recently, we've been spending most of our time building our own AI agents.  Over the last year, YC has mostly funded AI agent companies, so it's been cool to go really deep building our own AI agents too.  We're building agents to automate every aspect of what we do, and pushing the limits of what's possible with the current models to do it.

An unusual aspect of being on the YC software team is that you'll get full access to the YC program, founders and partners.  The YC batch runs in the same building we work out of, so there are talks with famous founders happening most nights, right downstairs in our building.  If you want to start a startup someday, working at YC would be an excellent jumping off point - several YC companies have come from team members who decided to start their own company.

YC works fully in-person in SF. We're happy to help you move here if you're in the US already.  Unfortunately we can't sponsor new visas, but we're happy to transfer existing ones.

YC offers highly competitive compensation and benefits.
