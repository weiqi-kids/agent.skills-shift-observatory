## 原始內容

Hardfin | Full-stack engineer | Denver metro, CO or Bay area, CA (REMOTE or ONSITE) | CA/CO ONLY | Full-time | 150k-180k salary (DOE)

Hardfin is a B2B software platform for equipment manufacturers that enables them to track their assets and manage projects for their hardware. We are looking to add another fullstack engineer that can wear a bit of a product hat and is comfortable with "figuring it out" as they build.

Short and transparent hiring process, 30 min intro call, 30 min tech screen, 30 min vision/product call, 2hr technical test, 45 min culture fit call, offer. No panels, no leet code questions.

Requirements: 5+ YoE, 3+ Go, 1+ Typescript, 6+ months of working with AI assisted IDE/tooling. Requirements are not firm, but you will be asked questions about Go and Typescript and it would be difficult to pass the tech screen without the experience.

IMPORTANT:
- You must be located in CA or CO, this isn't negotiable; ideally you are in the Oakland/SF or Denver area. We do not provide relocation.
- We do not have the ability to process or handle sponsorships at this time (visa's of any type) - you must be a citizen, permanent resident, or have work authorization that isn't tied to employment (IE refugee status).

You can reach me directly at bweisbart -at- hardfin (.) com, please include "HN" in the email subject so I can prioritize a response to you. We respond to all candidates (no voids) as long as you meet the the eligibility requirements.
