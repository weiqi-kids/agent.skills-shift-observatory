## 原始內容

Gambit Robotics | Founding Principal / Staff Full-Stack Engineer | NYC | Onsite | Full-time Hi! I’m Nicole (ex-Google AI), cofounder of Gambit Robotics with Eliot Horowitz (cofounder/CTO MongoDB). We’re hiring for two founding engineering roles to work directly with us in our NYC office (in-person only): 1) Founding Principal / Staff Full-Stack Engineer - 8+ years experience shipping production systems - Strong backend and systems foundation - Experience owning architecture end-to-end (zero → production) 2) Founding Full-Stack Engineer - 4–6 years experience building and shipping production products - Strong product sense and ownership - Comfortable working across backend, client, and infrastructure https://www.gambitrobotics.ai/careers Gambit is an AI-powered kitchen assistant that mounts magnetically under most range hoods or microwaves. It uses computer vision, thermal imaging, and on-device AI to understand what’s happening in the pan in real time, and handles the hardest parts of cooking — heat, timing, and doneness — so people get better results with less stress. We’re moving quickly from prototype to product and launching via Kickstarter later this month. It’s a seed-stage startup with high autonomy, real impact, and a very intense (and fun) next phase. If you or someone you know might be a fit, email me: nicole@gambitrobotics.com https://www.gambitrobotics.ai
