## 原始內容

Gumroad — NYC (onsite/hybrid) — Hiring Product/Engineering We build tools that help creators sell directly to their audiences. Small team, big surface area: you’ll ship end-to-end (product → design → code → metrics). Looking for: strong product-minded engineers (backend, full-stack, or generalist). Bonus if you’ve built marketplaces, payments, or creator tools. Nice-to-have stack: Rails/Stripe/Postgres/Redis/React/TypeScript—but we value ownership over checkboxes. Email sahil@gumroad.com with a couple links (GitHub, portfolio) and 2–3 sentences on why you want to build for creators.
