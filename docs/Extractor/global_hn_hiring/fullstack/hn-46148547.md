## 原始內容

Gambit Robotics | Senior Full-Stack Engineer | NYC | Onsite | Full-time Hi! I’m Nicole (Ex-Google AI), cofounder of Gambit Robotics with Eliot Horowitz (cofounder/CTO MongoDB). We’re hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer to work directly with us in our NYC office (in-person only). Gambit is an AI-powered kitchen assistant that mounts magnetically under most range hoods or microwaves. It uses computer vision, thermal imaging, and on-device AI to understand what’s happening in the pan in real time, and handles the hardest parts of cooking — heat, timing, and doneness — so people get better results with less stress. You: - 7–10 years of experience - Strong ownership and product sense - Thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous environments - Experience with IoT / hardware is a plus We’re moving quickly from prototype to product and launching at CES with a Kickstarter in January. It’s a seed-stage startup with high autonomy, real impact, and a very intense (and fun) next few months. If you or someone you know might be a fit, email me: nicole@gambitrobotics.com -> https://www.gambitrobotics.ai/ -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9XfUgxY-Rg
