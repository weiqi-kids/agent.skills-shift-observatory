## 原始內容

Miniswap | Founding Engineer | Full-time | ONSITE (hybrid) San Francisco | No visa sponsorships Miniswap is a marketplace for complex hobbies, starting with Warhammer. We're backed by Y Combinator and have just closed our seed funding round. In the past six weeks since we launched, users have listed $150,000 of tabletop wargaming miniatures for sale on Miniswap and over $15,000 have been sold. We're looking for a founding full-stack engineer who is passionate about their hobbies -- whether it be Warhammer, Magic: The Gathering, mechanical keyboards, fountain pens, you name it. We have an opinionated tech stack: deep use of PostgreSQL (composite types, functions, etc), Rust for our monolith, and HTMX with modern vanilla JS/CSS. Our mentality is to extract the utmost value we can get out of these technologies before introducing additional infrastructure and frameworks. No ORMs, npm, React, etc. If this prospect excites you, please reach out :) Previous professional Rust experience is not a strict requirement for the role. Compensation: $100-180k + 0.5%-2% equity Contact: zak@miniswap.gg
