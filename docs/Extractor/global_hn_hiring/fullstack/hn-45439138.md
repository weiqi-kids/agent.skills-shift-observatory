## 原始內容

Stealth Vertical AI Startup (a16z Speedrun 006) | Founding AI Engineer | San Francisco | Onsite | $120K + Top Equity

We're building the first AI mover in a massive, real-world industry crucial to keeping the modern world running. $100K ARR in 3 months and pre-seed from a16z speedrun.

Team: Not our first rodeo. Michael Holkesvik (me!) was CTO of series B company that raised $65m. Sanjay Dasari (nice guy!) is a 2× founder and scaled his last startup to $250M revenue. We have the best advisory board in the industry, and know how to have fun while building something massive.

Role: Work directly with us, and own full stack features end-to-end. You should be excited for customer site visits where we get the privilege of sharing our tools with expert blue collar workers. Not "forward deployed", but we need to be belly-to-belly on occasion to learn what's working.

You: Sharp and scrappy, excited about overlooked industries. 2-3 years experience, ideally writing code at an early stage startup. You're excited about cutting edge voice AI (pipecat, vapi), AI agents (Browserbase, Vercel AI SDK), and multimodal reasoning.
