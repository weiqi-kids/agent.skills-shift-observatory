Our leadership staff are ex-Fortune 100; everybody touches code. Notable recent projects: internal tools for Anduril, and the auction system for voltagepark.com. We’re currently especially seeking: Full-Stack Software Engineers (React, NextJS, Ruby on Rails; Typescript, Python; Database Design, Devops, and third-party API integrations) IoT Developers (Python, MQTT, GraphQL, AWS, Test Infrastructure) Please apply using this Google Form: https://forms.gle/Dxpj7eTwcHpjiGT39 .

REGARDING DECEMBER - if you already submitted to last December's post, and haven't heard from us yet, we're still getting to you. The team's been working really hard over the last year, and I unexpectedly gave most of the folks helping me with job submissions the time off at the end of December / beginning of January. Apologies for the delay, and we will be with you soon. Rest assured there are jobs we're trying to fill - in fact, more than ever, it seems.
