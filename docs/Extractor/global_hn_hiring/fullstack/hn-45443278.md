Third Iron | Senior Full-Stack Software Developer | REMOTE (US)

Do you want to develop software that helps scientists, doctors, and historians discover breakthroughs? Join our small, fully-distributed software development team to help connect scholars of all disciplines with peer-reviewed journal articles.

Our company has been remote-first since we began in 2011. You’ll join a team with plenty of experience putting into practice what works well remotely, and avoiding what doesn’t.
Third Iron has never taken VC money, and we’ve never had layoffs. Our approach to hiring and selling our products helps us feel confident that this pattern will continue far into the future.

Third Iron software is used by researchers at over 1,500 libraries, including universities, hospitals, corporations, and government agencies located in over 35 countries.

In a refreshing change from advertising-dependent tech companies and those who sell user data, we instead have a business-to-business model. We sell our subscription-based services to libraries, and anyone affiliated with one of these libraries can use our software. We do not sell user data. Our focus is on building the best software to enable research that changes the world.

We’re looking for a developer interested in full-stack work, since we have a variety of upcoming initiatives, some being mostly front-end, some being mostly back-end, and some a balance of the two.

The front-end of our stack primarily consists of JavaScript, using EmberJS for two major projects, and React for two others. Our backend is written in NodeJS, and features data storage using PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and CouchDB, and hosting primarily on AWS and HEroku.

If you’re interested in this fully remote position, we're interested to chat with you!
