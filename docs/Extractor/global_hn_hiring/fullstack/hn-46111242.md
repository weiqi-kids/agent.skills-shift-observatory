## 原始內容

Onton.com | Fullstack & Research Engineers | San Francisco, CA | Hybrid Join us in pioneering the future of e-commerce search. 1M+ MAU growing rapidly. Large seed round raised from top-tier VCs and individuals with backgrounds from Google, Amazon, OpenAI, Stitch Fix, Whatnot, Stripe, and more. We're a hard-working team of 10. We have an office in Jackson Square with a great view that we're looking to fill with other high-performance people! Tech-wise, it's React/Typescript + Julia, if that's interesting (no worries if you haven't used it). We've also built our own graph and vector DB to cope with the scale, and the foundations of a neuro-symbolic AI agent that learns more about the world on every search! Job posting and more information here → https://onton.com/careers We read and respond to every application.
