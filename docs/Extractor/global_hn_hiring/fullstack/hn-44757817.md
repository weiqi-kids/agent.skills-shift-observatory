Fundamental Research Labs | Fullstack and Product Engineers, Ex-founders, Researchers | Menlo Park, CA | https://fundamentalresearchlabs.com

We're an applied research company building autonomous, collaborative, and socially intelligent agents. Our small team includes computational neuroscientists, AI researchers, engineers, and builders from MIT EECS, Stanford NLP Group, Google X, Citadel, and beyond.

Our latest product, tryshortcut.ai, just launched a few days ago to amazing reception and we’re just getting started.

We compensate well above market and provide generous equity.

We’re looking for:

—> Product engineers and ex-founders to build Agent-first products. We have an organizational structure where product leaders are given great autonomy to experiment and ship fast.

—> Researchers to develop frontier technologies in the Agents domain. We do everything from sophisticated Agent orchestration to SFT/RL post-training of foundation models.
