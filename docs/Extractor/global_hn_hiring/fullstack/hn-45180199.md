Anvil (https://anvil.works) | Developer Advocate, Senior Developer | Cambridge, UK | ONSITE, VISA | Full-time/part-time/flexible

We make an open-source web framework, an online code editor, a GUI builder, and a PaaS hosting platform. Together, you can build and host a full-stack web application - and all you need is a little Python. (Yes, even the client-side code - we compile Python to JS with a Pythonic GUI framework!)

DEVELOPER ADVOCATE:

We’re looking for developers with great communication skills, to show people how to build awesome things with Anvil. You’ll be building example apps; writing how-to guides, blog posts and tutorials; presenting Anvil at conferences; and helping our users – from individual developers to huge tech companies – build their applications. And then you’ll help us work out how to improve Anvil for them.

It's rewarding work – developers love being introduced to Anvil (our stand is always crowded[0] at conferences!). Plus, there are all the advantages of a small startup: lots of autonomy and huge impact. You'll be working directly with the founders as well as some seriously talented colleagues.

SENIOR DEVELOPER:

We’re looking for an experienced all-rounder to work on the core Anvil platform, with a focus on the back-end. Our stack is mostly Clojure, Javascript, Python, Postgres, and container tools – but we're looking for someone who isn't afraid to jump into something you haven't used before.

You’ll be working with other seriously good all-rounders, including the founders (relevant PhDs, kernel contributors, built a dancing fountain for fun, that sort of thing) and senior colleagues (eg: Stu went from teaching Python in maths class to reverse-engineering our drag'n'drop editor in months), as well as our other developers and developer advocates. We're bootstrapped and profitable, with a small, smart, friendly and diverse team.

Building dev tools is great! We're solving problems we've experienced ourselves, our customers are developers just like us, and platforms have the most fun engineering problems.

---

We're bootstrapped and profitable, with customers ranging from tiny (one-person startups) to enormous (HSBC, Bayer, Deloitte, etc).

We work hybrid (in the office Tue-Thu, wherever you like Mon/Fri). If you have questions, I'm a founder and my email's in my profile.
