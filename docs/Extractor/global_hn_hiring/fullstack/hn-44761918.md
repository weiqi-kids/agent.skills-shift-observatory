Flexible, Fullstack Software Engineer role. Scan123 is small, has been around a while, and serves the auto dealership industry. The role will be part of an effort to branch out in new directions with a new codebase. They’ve got a mature product in LAMP, but this role is to work on brand new, green field adjacent products using React and Supabase (started on Lovable), deployed on Vercel. The codebase you’ll be primarily working in is now a few months old. Hoping for someone who has a good handle on using AI effectively to accelerate, especially with prototypes but also can take responsibility or code quality in a React app. Hybrid environment: Some meetings in-person, and general sense that you should come in to the office to collaborate or if it’s useful to you, not just because. 3-5 years experience.
