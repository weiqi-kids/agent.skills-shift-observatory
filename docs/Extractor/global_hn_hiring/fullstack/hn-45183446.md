pawaPay is building Africa’s leading payments platform, enabling businesses to move money seamlessly across borders and mobile money networks. We are looking for a skilled and passionate Full Stack Developer (with a strong emphasis on frontend) to join our Product-Led Growth (PLG) team.

In this role, you’ll focus on developing and optimising the pawaPay Dashboard and other merchant-facing tools, creating seamless, self-serve experiences that drive merchant activation, engagement, and long-term success. While your core expertise lies in frontend development, you’ll also bring backend knowledge and the ability to contribute to Java code reviews.

What you’ll do:

Build, test, and deploy features for merchant-facing dashboards and tools.

Translate design visions into clean, high-quality, responsive UI.

Integrate APIs and backend services, collaborating closely with product and design.

Participate in code reviews, with the ability to assess Java code.

Troubleshoot, debug, and optimise for performance and usability.

What we’re looking for:

5+ years of experience in full stack engineering, ideally in a product-led, data-rich environment (FinTech/payments a plus).

Strong skills in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and modern frameworks (Vue 3 preferred; React/Angular also valued).

Experience integrating APIs, working with design systems, and translating Figma files into production-ready UI.

Backend experience and the ability to read/review Java code.
