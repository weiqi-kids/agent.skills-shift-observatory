## 原始內容

Transfyr | AI/ML Software Engineer | Cambridge MA | Full-time | ONSITE or REMOTE (US) Transfyr is building the API layer for science. The business model of science is broken, leaving meaningful innovation and novel treatments lost in translation. Funding alone isn’t enough to solve the problem; we need a new paradigm for making scientific knowledge that is robust, reproducible, and transferable. At Transfyr, we are building the infrastructure to enable the exchange of scientific know-how between individuals and organizations, just as APIs create interfaces for software systems to seamlessly integrate. We build advanced multimodal and self-evolving AI tools to wrestle with the complex physical realities of science, enabling scientists to fully capture and translate what it really takes to move science beyond the lab. Key domains of expertise we’re looking for (hiring from entry level to senior leadership): * Computer Vision - take messy real-world images and video and make sense of them * AI / ML Research & Engineering - build the best digital brains to support the best physical brains on the planet * Full Stack Engineering - integrate our AI and data into tools that solve real customer problems If you're interested, apply here! https://transfyr.typeform.com/to/P5wmbK0V
