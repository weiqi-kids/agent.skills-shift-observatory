## 原始內容

LocalRoute.ai | Founding Engineer (Infra / Full-Stack) | NYC or REMOTE (US) We’re an early-stage startup building a privacy-first AI routing layer for teams running multiple models across on-prem and hybrid environments. The problem: AI workloads default to overpowered models and leak sensitive data because there’s no intelligent routing layer. We’re looking for a founding engineer who enjoys systems-level problems, ambiguity, and owning architecture end-to-end. You’ll help design routing logic, policy enforcement, and developer-facing interfaces from the ground up. Tech we’re working with / around: backend services, model orchestration, infra, performance, privacy boundaries (stack flexible at this stage). Location: NYC preferred, open to strong remote (US) Stage: very early, YC-bound Comp: equity (range depends on stage and fit) Email: Team@localroute.ai (include a few lines on what you’ve built and what excites you)
