Scholarly | Software Engineer | Seattle, On-Site | Full-Time | $130k - $200k + equity + health benefits + equipment budget

Scholarly is building the HR operating system for higher education. We've built a software platform that enables our customers to make data-driven decisions and to automate essential processes like performance reviews, tenure processes, leave workflows, and more. We are a venture-backed seed stage company of experienced, motivated, and collaborative folks. We are backed by leading investors in the industry and working with some of the best universities in the US.

We're looking for a full-stack candidate without about 5 years of experience building web applications. We write Ruby and Rails, but we are considering candidates with other stack experiences. Engineering is based in Seattle and on site in Pioneer Square. Looking to get back to a collaborative, in-office culture post-COVID? Let's chat.
