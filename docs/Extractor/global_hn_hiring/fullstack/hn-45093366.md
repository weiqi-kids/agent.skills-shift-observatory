Komodo Health | Applied AI Engineer | Full-Time | $200-$253k + equity... | SF/NY Once-a-month-few-days / Remote US. Can sponsor.

Healthcare in the U.S. is a mess. Komodo Health is fixing that—with data. We’ve mapped the patient journey across the country to build the most complete picture of disease burden and treatment gaps. Our customers are pharma, payers, and health systems who actually want to do something meaningful with that information.

We have an exciting product, marmot, that is AI-native, both in the interface as well as in development, and want to carefully grow high productivity teams around this offering. AI integrated with Komodo's data is giving some of the most unique, real world insights any of us has seen come out of the new LLM era. Our product was just featured on Times Sqaure too! https://www.linkedin.com/posts/komodo-health_last-week-our-d...

We are looking for highly independent individuals, who can work in a new, small, but empowered team. What will you be bringing? - Proven experience working on Agentic systems that solve real problems OR Some evidence you have the "instinct" Andrew Ng mentions as the differentiators of successful Agent builders. We also take full ownership of the product, so experience+readiness for fullstack development is a must. Core ML experience is not required and for this position, not relevant at all. The new LLM/Agent era is... different.

Perks will include annual conference trip, periodic travel to SF/NY for on-site, Executive Coaching, etc.

If this post sounds exciting, please apply at https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/komodohealth/jobs/806961600... (mention HN as the source). Please note, we can only consider applicants who are already in the US.

If you wish, please also email me at ramraj.velmurugan@komodohealth.com with an example of how you have figured out that instinct I mention above.
