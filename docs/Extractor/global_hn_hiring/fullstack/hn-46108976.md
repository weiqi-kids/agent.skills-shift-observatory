SmarterDx | 150-250k+ + equity + benefits | Remote (US only) | Multiple roles | https://smarterdx.com/careers We build clinical AI that empowers hospitals to analyze the complete record of every patient to fully capture the value of care delivered. Founded by physicians in 2020, our proprietary AI platform understands the nuances of clinical reasoning, enabling hospitals to accurately reflect every patient visit for fair reimbursement. By doing so, hospitals can recover millions in earned revenue, enhance care outcome and quality metrics, and optimize healthcare operations. The current team is very high functioning (MD + data scientist combos, former ASF board member, Google and Amazon engineers, Stanford LLM researchers, etc.) and initially scaled the company to $1MM+ in contracted revenue without raising capital. SmarterDx recently became part of Smarter Technologies as part of a $1.1B deal by New Mountain Capital, a leading growth-oriented investment firm. We have been backed by top investors including Floodgate (Lyft, Twitch, Twitter), Transformation Capital, and Bessemer for a total of $71M, including our $50M Series B, and are experiencing an incredible growth trajectory customer and revenue wise with no signs of slowing down with 150% YoY headcount growth! This time last year, we were at ~110 employees, and are above 280 as of today! We are looking for: Security Engineering Manager - Staff and Senior SWEs, Full Stack and Backend focused - Staff ML Engineers - Data Science Managers - Staff Data Scientists - Senior Data Analysts - Senior Product Managers - More! We have PMF, and it's time to scale! For more and to apply, see https://smarterdx.com/careers
