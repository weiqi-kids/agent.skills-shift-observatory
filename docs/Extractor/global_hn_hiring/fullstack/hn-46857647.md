Charted Sea | Senior Product & Platform Engineer | REMOTE | Full-time
Location: Hong Kong
<a href="https://chartedsea.com/about" rel="nofollow">https://chartedsea.com/about</a><p>Charted Sea is a small, bootstrapped SaaS company helping customers scrape very complex platforms such as Shopee (a major e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia). We focus on hard technical problems (anti-bot, browser automation, fingerprinting, captcha solving).<p>We are hiring a senior engineer to take ownership of our core platform: scraper orchestrator, billing & payments, customer dashboard, and parts of our AI-based captcha tooling. This is a hands-on role with real ownership: architectural decisions, setting standards, and gradually mentoring other engineers. The role is very full-stack (infra, backend, frontend).<p>Stack includes TypeScript (most backend & web), Rust (new backend services, migration in progress), Go (Android scraper), PyTorch (captcha solvers), PostgreSQL, Redis, GitHub Actions, Ansible, Ubuntu Linux, bare-metal Hetzner servers.<p>We are profitable, demand is growing fast, and engineering bandwidth is the main bottleneck. Team is small (3 engineers), fully remote, mostly async (we expect ~4h overlap with UTC+8).<p>Compensation: $80k–$120k USD base (depending on experience) + monthly bonus tied to company revenue (10% of net revenue shared with employees).<p>Apply by emailing marc.plouhinec@chartedsea.com with a short intro and CV/GitHub. I'm the founder and will personally read and reply.
