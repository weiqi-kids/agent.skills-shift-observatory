## 原始內容
Kinelo | kinelo.com | Full-Stack Engineer (AI + Backend) | San Francisco | Onsite<p>Kinelo manages the new type of hybrid team that will emerge in the future: humans+AI working shoulder-to-“shoulder”.<p>Our first product helps human software engineering teams deliver more efficiently and more reliably by assisting in coordination and engineering management. But it’s built on a foundational layer that ingests data, knowledge, and process across communications and systems, exposing that to humans and AI alike.<p>Eventually, Kinelo will become a proper human+AI orchestration layer, managing entire companies, and our goal is to have Kinelo run Kinelo (we already dogfood it today).<p>We’re looking for high ownership individuals to join our small team and shape its direction. We also just opened a new SF office and new hires will have the ability to help shape company culture, engineering practices, architecture, and roadmap.<p>We’re well-funded (just raised another round), founded by a serial founder, anti-bureaucratic, and highly technical.<p>We’re looking for:<p>- Those who want to go 0 to 1 with high ownership: moving features and products from idea on a napkin, to prototype, to engineering UI, to shipped and polished product<p>- ~8 years professional experience, including the pre-LLM days with strong CS fundamentals<p>- A balance of wisdom from experience and optimism about the future<p>- Strong TypeScript and Postgres (or other RDBMS) experience at scale and with high reliability (SaaS apps, APIs, etc)<p>- Experience with a variety of technologies, including containerization, distributed systems, and at least one strongly typed programming language (Go, C++, Java, etc)<p>- Ideally experience with ML and AI systems (though expertise in ML, data science, etc is not needed for this role)<p>We can’t sponsor visas but relocation assistance to SF is possible.<p>Please apply here: <a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/kinelo/jobs/4088659009" rel="nofollow">https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/kinelo/jobs/4088659009</a> and also email jobs@kinelo.com, mentioning this post.
