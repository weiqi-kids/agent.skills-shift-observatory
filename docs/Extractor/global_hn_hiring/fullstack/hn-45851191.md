## 原始內容

Senior Backend Software Engineer, Rive.app Remote U.K. Full time. We're on a mission to make hard-coded graphics a thing of the past with a new general-purpose graphics format for all types of software and Ul. The backend team builds and operates the systems behind Rive’s cloud platform, focusing on the services and infrastructure that provide the core APIs, real-time collaboration, file storage, and background processing for the editor. We also own a few full-stack services that power the marketplace and customer-facing experiences, with the ability to rebuild big parts of the backend. Requirements 8+ years of professional software engineering experience, specifically in backend and infrastructure. Proven track record of owning and delivering backend services for SaaS-based products that are widely relied upon by active users. Node.js experience, or strong experience in multiple programming languages and evidence of learning new ones quickly. Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS preferred), infrastructure as code, and container orchestration. Strong SQL skills, including hands-on experience with query analysis and optimization. Ability to work independently in ambiguous situations: seek out requirements, make sound decisions, and prioritize effectively. Excellent communication skills, with willingness to work directly with customers when needed. apply: https://apply.workable.com/rivecareers/j/E4C131B413/
