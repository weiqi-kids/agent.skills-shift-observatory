## 原始內容

PrairieLearn (Remote US) — Full-Stack Software Engineer — TypeScript / Node / Postgres / AI PrairieLearn ( https://www.prairielearn.com ) is an open-source assessment platform originally developed at the University of Illinois and now used by universities across the US (Berkeley, Princeton, Michigan, UIUC, and others). We power mastery-based learning, interactive question generators, and large-scale exams. We’re a small, profitable, early-stage company (bootstrapped, no VC) and we’re hiring a full-stack engineer to help us continue to grow. You’ll work across the stack and have meaningful ownership from day one. We’re also developing AI tooling in the product: * LLM-based agents to help instructors create and test new question generators * Vision-language models for grading student-submitted work (e.g., math derivations, diagrams, sketches) This is practical, user-facing AI work with real-world impact — not a research sandbox. Tech we use: * Node.js / TypeScript backend, Postgres, AWS, React * PrairieLearn is open core: https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn You might be a fit if you: * Have experience with full-stack web development (TypeScript / Python / SQL / HTML/CSS) * Enjoy working directly with users (many are instructors and TAs) * Want to own features end-to-end, from idea to rollout * Are excited about building practical AI integrations, not just demos Details: * Location: Remote (US only) * Salary: $100k+ depending on experience * Benefits: Stock options, unlimited PTO, flexible hours * Role: Full-time. (We’re not able to sponsor visas at this time.) If this sounds interesting, please email jobs@prairielearn.com. We’d love to talk. Official job posting: https://www.prairielearn.com/jobs
