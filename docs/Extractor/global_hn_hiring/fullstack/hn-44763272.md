Apollo Agriculture | Full Stack Software Engineer | Full-time | Amsterdam, NL | https://www.apolloagriculture.com/team
Apollo Agriculture (YC F1) is bringing modern farming to the world's poorest farmers. Millions of farmers globally don't have access to the basic resources the rest of the world depends on for food production: good seed and fertilizer. We sell these on credit, use ML to figure out who we can lend to profitably, and are growing rapidly (two countries and growing).

We are a small, motivated team with SV roots and an ownership culture. Come help us make a real difference in the world!

Our core engineering team supports a wide range of tools and processes. Our primary stack is Scala 2 w/ cats, backed by psql. If you are an experienced and practical problem solver, we'd love to meet you.

... due to our size and focus, we look for candidates who are experienced and can be autonomous -- at least at the "senior" level. Visa sponsorship is possible!

Drop me a line at elijah@apolloagriculture.com if you're interested; I'm happy to chat.
