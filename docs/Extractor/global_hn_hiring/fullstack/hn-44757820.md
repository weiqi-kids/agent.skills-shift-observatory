Do you feel overwhelmed by the amount of stuff to learn? Do you have hundreds of books and articles in your to-read list, but wish you could extract the main ideas faster?

The goal of Shortform is to make the world's best ideas more accessible. We started by creating the world's best book guides, with in-depth chapter-by-chapter summaries, original insights building on the book, and distillation of ideas into actionables. They're like superpowered book summaries.

Our ultimate goal is to index every idea on Earth and make sense of it. Specifically, we want to summarize and contextualize every meaningful idea published each day, in every form of media (books, articles, podcasts, videos, news, research papers). Illustrative ideas include a news summarizer that shows the entire spectrum of opinions on a topic to help avoid polarization, and mini-courses that draw from the best sources across media to teach a topic (eg to learn negotiation, start with this book, then listen to this interview, then see these news articles for the principles at work, do these exercises).

If ideas like these interest you, please apply.

--------

Company status: We launched 6 years ago. Shortform was funded by the founder (who has built multiple bootstrapped profitable companies in the past) and has taken on no outside investment. Our financials allow us to be profitable, but currently we're reinvesting in growth. Engineering team consists of 10 full-stack engineers.

Technology: Vue.js on frontend, Flask / Python on backend, with heavy R&D in AI / LLM / GPT. (Keywords for searchers with tech flexibility: Angular, React, Django | BERT, LLaMA, Natural Language Processing / NLP, Large Language Models, ML)

About the role: Ideally you're fullstack on the web, and comfortable on both front-end and back-end. Position is remote (current team is worldwide). Fulltime roles preferred; hours negotiable for strong candidates. We're able to pay competitive market salaries (i.e. not decreased by equity).

Email jobs+engineerhn@shortform.com to get more details about the company, what we're building, and the application process. In your email, please discuss your experience for our stack, and also your favorite non-fiction book (to help us screen spam emails).
