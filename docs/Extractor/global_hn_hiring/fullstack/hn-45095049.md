Talk Machine | Founding Engineers | Remote (or London, Dubai, San Francisco) | https://talkmachine.com/jobs

Hello. I’m the founder of Talk Machine, previously founded Citymapper.

We’re working on building a consumer voice product / platform using AI, driven by the mission to improve human communication.

Our application process is unique. Just go to https://talkmachine.com/jobs and send us a voice note and we can begin talking, just like we met in person.

We have 2 specific posts, https://talkmachine.com/jobs/engineer for full stack founding engineers and https://talkmachine.com/jobs/mobile for iOS/Android, but glad to hear from anyone that loves the product/category.

We’re seed funded and can pay competitively + quality stock options (EMI in UK).

You like: talking, consumer, voice, AI, small fast teams, building great products, chasing product market fit
