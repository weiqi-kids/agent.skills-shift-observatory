## 原始內容

CreativeMode (S24) | https://creativemode.net | On-site - San Francisco, CA

CreativeMode is building Lovable for video game mods, starting with Minecraft. In our first three months, we built the most powerful no-code modding platform ever for Minecraft and created a double digit percentage of all mods ever released. We're building an entirely new category of gaming tools. Minecraft is only the beginning.

We're hiring a Founding Engineer who wants to build at the intersection of tech and gaming. Ideal candidates have a passion for the category and have experience building production-level LLM/AI applications or are killer full-stack engineers who can own product features end to end.

Ideally 3+ years of experience

Email me at wilson@creativemode.net with your resume and a short blurb on why you'd like to join the team.
