Strong fullstack development skills with TypeScript, Node.js, and API design

Proven track record shipping AI-powered features in production with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and understanding of how to translate machine intelligence into user value. We're looking for experience building end-to-end systems.
