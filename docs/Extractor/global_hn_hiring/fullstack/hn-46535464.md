## 原始內容

I have adapted our "Stealth" pitch to fit their strict format while keeping the "Nerd Bait" hook. Stealth PropTech Startup | Boston, MA (or Remote) | Founding Full-Stack Engineer | CONTRACT TO HIRE | Competitive Market Rate + Equity We are looking for a "Mad Scientist" engineer to build a living, gamified dashboard that disrupts a massive legacy industry (Consumer Logistics/Real Estate). The Stack: React, Next.js, Supabase, Node.js. (Bonus: Framer Motion/GSAP). The Project: This isn't a CRUD app. It is a "Command Center" that feels like a video game. It features a dynamic "AI Companion" (Nook) that actively coaches users through complex financial and logistical phases. We need someone who can take a "Frankenstein" MVP concept and turn it into a high-performance, secure, living organism. About You: * You treat your IDE like a video game. * You obsess over micro-interactions and "game feel." * You want to be Employee #1 on a product that solves a universal anxiety point for 40k+ users in Boston alone. The Deal: * Mode: Contract-to-hire. We start with the MVP build (paid project). If you survive the mission, you become the Founding Engineer. * Culture: No Jira. No PMs. Just code and shipping. To Apply: Email me at jobroplus@gmail.com Do NOT send a resume. Send ONE link to the coolest/weirdest thing you have ever built. Show me code with a soul.
