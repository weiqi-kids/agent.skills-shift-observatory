Brico | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE (Hybrid OK)| Full-Time | https://www.brico.ai

Brico takes the hassle out of financial licensing for Financial Institutions and FinTechs. We automate new license applications, maintenance, and renewals, creating a 1-stop shop for all licensing needs. Put simply, we are creating from the ground-up dedicated AI-augmented software to manage complex regulatory compliance workflows that used to live in spreadsheets and emails, across all 50+ US jurisdictions.

We are a small but mighty full-stack engineering team of 4, taking on any challenge that's thrown at us in order to build for and support our growing customer base ranging from ambitious crypto startups to established Fortune 500 financial services companies.

I am hiring a senior full-stack engineer to join our team that ships using django/python/react. You can find the job description at https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/pear/0c3aca7d-12dc-415f-b405-09ea2a... or email me (co-founder/cto) at ed [-at-] brico.ai with HN in the subject line.
