Aha! (https://www.aha.io) | Rails / React / Devops | REMOTE

Aha! is the #1 tool for product managers to plan strategy and roadmaps. We serve more than 700,000 users worldwide. We are looking for:
* Experienced full-stack Rails and security engineers to work on the Aha! product. Our application is built in Ruby on Rails, with React on the frontend for rich client-side experiences.

* Devops engineers with Ruby experience. We focus on the "dev" and all of our operations driven by code.

Aha! is profitable, you can work from anywhere in North or South America, and we offer excellent benefits. We use our own product to manage our work (which is especially rewarding) and we deploy continuously.

Our entire team has always been 100% remote - in North American timezones so we can collaborate during the work day.
