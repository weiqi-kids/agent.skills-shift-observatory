ScribbleVet (https://scribblevet.com) | Full-stack, former technical founders | Full-time | Remote (must be able to work US timezones)

ScribbleVet is an AI-powered scribe for veterinarians. We save veterinarians two hours every day, reduce veterinary burnout and help animals get better care.

* We're generating real ($XM/yr) revenue

* Our users love the product

* We're fully remote but not asynchronous, so we have a lot of autonomy but it's easy to collaborate with someone when needed.

We're looking for:

* Senior engineers (former founders or early startup experience strongly preferred) who can work across the stack.

* Engineers with a product mindset. Customer-centricity or design skills are a plus.

Our tech stack: Postgres, Elixir (+ Ash framework), React Native/Expo, React/Nextjs

We’ve found that the engineers who are happy and successful at Scribble really enjoy technology (learning new frameworks, experimenting with cutting-edge platforms) and are very product-oriented.
