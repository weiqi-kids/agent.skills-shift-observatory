Location: Bratislava, Slovakia (comfortable with different time zones - partly overlapping etc.) Remote: Yes Willing to relocate: No Technologies: HTML/CSS (SASS, Tailwind), JavaScript (Vanilla, jQuery, React, Next.js, React Native), PHP (WordPress custom theme development with Twig and ACF, Gutenberg editor/Core), Python (Backend/AI/Web Scraping), Web Accessibility, Git, Figma Resume/CV: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Lg7HblO1DD2OCfTt7wdk8rft4P... Email: gio97niko@gmail.com About me: Hi, I’m Giorgi — a Full-Stack Web Developer with around four years of experience in frontend development and about a year in backend and AI-related work. I’ve collaborated in various settings — from freelancing individually to working with teams in digital agency and startup — which helped me develop strong adaptability and teamwork skills. Most of my career has focused on building and maintaining WordPress websites (custom themes, ACF, Twig, Gutenberg), but over the past two years I’ve also been involved in React/Next.js projects. Recently, I’ve taken a growing interest in backend and AI development through my work at Onconest, an AI-powered health startup, where I contribute to both backend and AI implementation. I’m passionate about clean, accessible web experiences — over the last year, I’ve led accessibility improvements for large-scale projects in a US-based digital agency. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and take on new challenges where I can deliver results and make an impact.
