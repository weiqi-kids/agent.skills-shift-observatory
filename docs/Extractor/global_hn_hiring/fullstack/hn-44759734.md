Relativity Space | Long Beach, CA / Stennis, MS | Full-time

Multiple software teams hiring to help build the next great orbital launch company. Our Terran-R vehicle will be a strong competitor to Falcon (and bigger) and will launch late next year.

Software roles include full-stack web devs, embedded, low level performance, data pipeline engineering, and more. Teams work on projects like our in-house systems powering the factory, our ground control system, telemetry ingestion, data analysis tools and flight software.

If you're interested in learning about hardware manufacturing, excited about space, and want to build high quality software for engineers across all disciplines... come work with us! No prior aerospace experience required at all.

Search for "Terrestrial Software" and "Vehicle Software" on our careers page for roles including more details and our pay ranges: https://www.relativityspace.com/jobs

Earlier this year Eric Schmidt joined as CEO and invested in a big way -- his involvement is doubling down on our commitment to building high quality software teams in-house, and we're hiring across the board.
