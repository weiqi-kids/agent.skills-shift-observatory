## 原始內容
Elsewhere | TypeScript Game Developer | San Francisco

Ever wanted to build indie video games at a startup? Let's talk.
Elsewhere is a San Francisco-based company building a new kind of multiplayer social video game, inspired by indie roguelike deckbuilding games like Slay the Spire and CCGs like Magic: The Gathering.
We're using generative AI in a creatively interesting way to build the first AI game that doesn't suck.
We're backed by top Silicon Valley investors, and graduated from the first cohort of a16z's SPEEDRUN program, which is kind of like YC for games.

Ideally, you:

* Have worked as a software engineer before, ideally on a small team.
* Have built and shipped games before, either professionally or on your own time.
* Have experience with full-stack web development, using TypeScript, React, etc.
* Love games yourself, and have always wanted to work in the games industry.
