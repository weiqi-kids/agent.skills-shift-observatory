## 原始內容

Dispatch Care - Remote (US time zones required) - Full Stack Engineer

We make an app that helps hospital patients communicate with their care team, saving busy nurses time.

I think this would be a great role for someone with a few years of experience with Rails / mobile development and is eager to learn a lot and take on a lot of ownership.
