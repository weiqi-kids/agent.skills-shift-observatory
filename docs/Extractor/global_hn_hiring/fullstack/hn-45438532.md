## 原始內容

ReciPal (https://www.recipal.com) | Founding Rails/Full Stack Software Engineer | REMOTE | Full-Time

We aren't actually hiring anyone immediately, but we've hired a handful of great engineers from HN and inevitably will need to hire again. We've found having those conversations and keeping in touch is much better than going through the process from scratch each time, as it fast tracks the process a great deal when the time comes. So reach out if you think you're a good fit.

ReciPal is a profitable, growing, bootstrapped, and (have always been a) fully remote company (based in New York) with 6 full-time employees. We make simple software for food businesses - nutrition analysis and labeling, costing, and inventory management. We've been around for almost 15 years now!

You'd be working directly with me, solo founder, our senior engineers, and marketing and support colleagues, and hopefully take on a growing role over time to treat the business like your own. It's a very low key work environment, but independent and plenty of responsibility and ownership for the right person.

Stack includes Rails 8, JavaScript, Postgres, Heroku.
