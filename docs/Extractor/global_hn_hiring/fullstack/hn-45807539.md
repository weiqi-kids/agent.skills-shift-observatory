Careforce AI | Senior Fullstack Engineer | REMOTE (US) | Full-time Healthcare administration is stuck in the era of the fax machine—manual, frustrating, and incredibly slow. At Careforce AI, we are building autonomous AI agents that eliminate this administrative burden, freeing medical teams to actually care for patients. Our AI finds, calls, and schedules patients, breaking the interoperability barriers that have plagued healthcare for 40 years. We're a well-funded, YC-backed company with massive customer demand. We're looking for a Senior Fullstack Engineer to be a foundational member of our small, ambitious team. You'll have significant ownership and work across the stack (Python, FastAPI, React, Supabase) to build and scale the core of our AI agent platform. This is a role for a builder who wants to solve hard problems and see their work have a massive, real-world impact. What we're looking for: Experience in an early-stage startup (pre-seed to Series A). 5+ years of full-stack experience (Python/React preferred, but we're flexible). Familiarity with LLMs and interest in building agents Stack: (Python/FastAPI, React, Supabase, GCP) Excellent generalist problem solver If you’re excited about building technology that solves a meaningful problem, apply here ( https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/careforce-prev-helpcar... ) with your background and why you're interested in what we're building.
