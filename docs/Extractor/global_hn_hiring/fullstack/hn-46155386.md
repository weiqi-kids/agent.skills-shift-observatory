## 原始內容

Parabola | Senior SRE + Full Stack Engineer | NYC/SF Hybrid | Full-time We're building the AI-powered workflow automation platform that ops and finance teams at Lyft, Flexport, WHOOP, 1000+ other companies use to escape spreadsheet hell. They get messy data from PDFs, emails, Excel files, APIs... We let non-technical teams build production-grade data pipelines by typing what they want in plain English. Senior SRE: Join our platform team. Own reliability, security, and developer experience. You'll be on-call but working on interesting problems: scaling multi-tenant infrastructure, securing 100+ integrations, building tools that make deploys boring (in a good way). Bonus if you care about the product, not just the pipes. Senior Full Stack Engineer: Be your own PM. Build new interfaces and features that unlock automation for people who've never written code. Work across the stack on problems like: LLM-powered pipeline generation, parsing messy PDFs with AI, real-time collaboration on workflows. If you've ever thought "I could automate this if I had time," come build the tool that lets everyone think that way. Apply: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/parabola-io or email cj@parabola.io
