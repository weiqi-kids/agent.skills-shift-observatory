trufflepig.ai | Founding Engineer | Full-Time | SF, CA | $150K - $200K + Meaningful Equity Join as the 4th team member to redefine the most universal interface in business: the spreadsheet. We are building an AI spreadsheet that automates knowledge work, allowing users to describe tasks in plain English and get immediate, trustworthy results. We launched a few months ago, already have paying customers, and are backed by top investors like Base10 (Brex, Figma). This is a massive opportunity to take the interface for this market shift. Compensation & Equity: $150,000 - $200,000 + meaningful early-stage ownership We're building the tool that saves users hours of manual work (data cleaning, formula building) currently required by legacy spreadsheets. Our team includes engineers who shipped production AI and distributed systems at Microsoft and VMware. We intend to replace Excel and Google Sheets by building the spreadsheet that truly understands what users want. Why We’re Hiring a Founding Engineer You will own the core product end-to-end, building AI agents that reason over data and evolving our spreadsheet engine for correctness and scale. You'll ship critical UX that allows non-technical teams to get analysis in plain English. We need a generalist who moves fast across the full stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and Rust + WASM. High agency, high ownership, and a focus on user trust are essential. Stack: Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Rust + WASM, AI Agents, Data Reasoning.
