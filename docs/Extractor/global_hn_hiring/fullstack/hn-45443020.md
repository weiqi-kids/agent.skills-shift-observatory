Tl;dr: I'm looking for someone that thoroughly enjoys Claude Code or Codex and wants to put the AI to work!

We're creating state of the art Generative Voice AI models. Looking for full stack, frontend and machine learning engineers that would love to create prototypes directly with the founders. Recently, we open sourced a state of the art speech enhancement model: https://github.com/resemble-ai/resemble-enhance

Here's what we're looking for:

Frontend Engineer - We're looking for a Frontend Engineer to build intuitive interfaces for our AI platform. You'll work with React/TypeScript to create exceptional user experiences that make complex AI technology accessible to both developers and enterprise users.

Full Stack Engineer - We are seeking a skilled Full Stack Engineer with experience with both Javascript and Python to join us. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in building and deploying web applications, a passion for working on cutting-edge AI technologies, and the ability to collaborate closely with our founders to create innovative prototypes.

Backend Engineer - Looking for Ruby on Rails and/or Python Developers to join our backend team. Scale up ML systems, make inference run more efficiently, and expose public facing APIs.

DevRel - We're looking for a Developer Relations engineer to champion our voice AI APIs and open-source projects within the developer community. The ideal candidate will create compelling demos, technical content, and documentation while helping developers integrate our AI models.

Growth Marketing - Seeking a data-driven growth marketer to accelerate adoption of our AI models across enterprise and developer segments.
