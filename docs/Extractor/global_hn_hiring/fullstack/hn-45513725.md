## 原始內容

Software Engineer (w/m/d) | Berlin | Onsite | Media4Care

We build tech: digital assistants that help caregivers and seniors live with more joy. Small senior team, big impact.

Stack: TypeScript (full-stack), React Native, GraphQL, Postgres, Bedrock (Claude/Llama), Transcribe, pgvector RAG, SageMaker + Inferentia2, VPC + KMS, Guardrails.

Work: End-to-end feature ownership, product thinking, clean abstractions, meaningful AI/LLM integration.

You: 5+ years experience, strong programming skills, can think in tradeoffs, not just libraries.

Why us:

Purpose > vanity metrics (healthcare, not adtech)

Autonomy + flat team

Modern stack, real-world constraints (accessibility, privacy, offline)

Process: short written Qs → intro call → 4–6h real-world coding/product challenge → tech discussion → fast offer.
