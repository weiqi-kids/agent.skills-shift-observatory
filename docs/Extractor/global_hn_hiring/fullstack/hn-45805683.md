## 原始內容

EQTY Lab | Software Engineers (Fullstack / AI ), or DevRel | SF, LA (looking for local, but wfh if cool) | Full Time | https://www.eqtylab.io/ We are hiring software engineer(s) to help innovate on applied agentic applications and governance/alignment at runtime. Specifically, you will help us release and further enhance https://github.com/eqtylab/cupcake - a solution derived from our Claude Code feature request for hooks. We believe hooking into the agent harnesses will be critical for scaled adoption; ambitions for purely LLM-driven trusted behavior exist today- but we must empower those responsible for run-time with deterministic guarantees. We do so by hooking into the harnesses - Claude Code, and now supported by Cursor, soon Gemini CLI. Beyond coding agents, we look to apply this to web harness agents, whether it's LangChain, Google ADK, etc. We are looking for an engineer, or devrel equiv, that can: - help develop across the full stack from an integration perspective (build the supporting bindings and SDK abstractions for web-based frameworks) - create quality demonstrations/tutorials/advocacy - continue to advance on the forefront of agentic security as well as better performance for agents. Competitive salary and equity. ramos at eqtylab.io
