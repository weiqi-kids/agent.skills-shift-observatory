Waypoint AI | Senior Backend, Fullstack, Frontend | Prague + REMOTE (CZ) | Full-time | Equity<p>We're building Chip — an AI support engineer that autonomously triages, routes, and resolves complex technical support cases. Think: a teammate that reads every Jira ticket, every Intercom thread, and every runbook, then actually acts on them.<p>Czech-American B2B startup, raised $3.1M. Already in production with Volvo, ClickHouse, and others.<p>We're a small eng team where early architectural decisions still matter. We use AI daily as a collaborator (Claude Code) — not as a gimmick, but because it genuinely makes us faster. We value craft, ownership, and shipping in small slices.<p>Stack: Django + Django Ninja, Postgres, Dramatiq (background jobs), React/Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind.<p>Hiring for three roles:<p>Senior Backend Engineer (AI Systems) — Own APIs, data pipelines, and durable workflows. LLM product experience (evals, cost/latency, vector search) is a plus. <a href="https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/senior-backend-engineer-ai-systems" rel="nofollow">https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/senior-backend-engineer...</a><p>Fullstack Engineer — Backend-heavy with enough frontend to be dangerous. End-to-end ownership from schema to UI. <a href="https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/fullstack-engineer" rel="nofollow">https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/fullstack-engineer</a><p>Frontend Developer — Build interfaces that make complex AI feel simple. React/Next.js/TS/Tailwind. Product-minded, not just pixel-pushing. <a href="https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/frontend-developer" rel="nofollow">https://mywaypoint.ai/open-positions/frontend-developer</a><p>Office in Prague 7 (Holešovice), remote-friendly. Competitive CZ-market comp + meaningful equity.<p>To apply: joinus@mywaypoint.ai — include a project you shipped end-to-end and how you use AI tooling in your workflow. Mention HN.
