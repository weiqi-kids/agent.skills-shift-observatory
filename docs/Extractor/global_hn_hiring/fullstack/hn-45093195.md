Greenline unlocks mortgage lending for self-employed borrowers.

We just closed our seed round led by Bowery Capital and Uncork to tackle this messy problem. More importantly, we're launching with the largest lenders and investors in the mortgage-backed securities market.

We're growing our founding team:

- product/ full stack engineer: own and accelerate customer-facing feature development

- backend: lead core, data-centric systems and infrastructure

- platform/ API: architect and build a public-facing ergonomic API for scalable integrations with enterprise systems, critical to unlocking key customers and partner-driven growth.
