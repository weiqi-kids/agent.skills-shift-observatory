## 原始內容

Viam (NYC-based robotics and AI platform, Series C, founded by co-founder of MongoDB and long time CTO) is hiring a Staff Software Engineer for our Motion Planning team. Backend development in Golang.

Viam is a full stack engineering platform that enables our users to work with devices (robotics, IoT, hardware etc) in the physical world. It's an extensive platform that starts with low-level integrations with any sensor or actuators, and enables you to connect and manage everything in the cloud; with that it is simple to get data from the physical world into the cloud, and taking action on it back in the physical world is just as easy.
Everything in Viam is pluggable and modular. You can add support for any device you need, any algorithm you want, or any model training or inference engine you care to use.
