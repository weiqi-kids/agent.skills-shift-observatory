## 原始內容

Atomscale | Software Engineer, Full Stack | Boston, MA (Hybrid Onsite) | https://atomscale.ai Atomscale is building AI to improve atomic-scale materials manufacturing. Our goal is to help translate new materials into new technologies and products by making sure they can be created at scale instead of stalling at R&D. This is a hard (but exciting!) challenge that involves high-throughput data ingestion and processing pipelines, complex materials science data visualization, and hardware integrations for direct synthesis control. The payoff is unlocking new technologies that address today's most pressing challenges. ⎯ We're looking for a Product-oriented Software Engineer that will: - Build ergonomic interfaces for data visualization, workflow automation, and AI-copilot assistance. - Develop backend systems with flexible, expressive data models and performant APIs. - Create desktop apps for on-premises low-latency data streaming and hardware integrations. (You don't need background in materials science) ⎯ More details: https://www.atomscale.ai/careers/software-engineer-full-stac... To apply: email jobs@atomscale.ai with the job title + HN
