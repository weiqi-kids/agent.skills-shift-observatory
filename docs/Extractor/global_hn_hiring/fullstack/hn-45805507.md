## 原始內容

Ascento | Zurich, Switzerland | Full Stack | https://www.ascento.ai Ascento develops autonomous security robots that patrol outdoor areas to detect and report. All in support of security guards. We stay away from conflict, just robots driving circles around buildings in remote boring places. The technical challenges however, are far from boring. We are looking for a full stack engineer to join as a core member of the off-robot software team. This is the software that plans, configures, operates and creates insights from data collected from the robots. You would work across the whole cloud-stack, consisting of Frontend (React), Backend (Typescript / Go), Infra (Terraform / AWS / GCP). The cloud software team is still small, meaning you get a chance to help set priorities, guide long-term architectural direction and figure out how to best help our users. We celebrate pragmatism, we work hard to make simple systems and we help each other to hyperfocus. Sounds like the place for you? Drop an email to sijmen@ascento.ai. I'm curious to read what about this ad caught your interest.
