## 原始內容

Parabola | Senior SRE + Full Stack Engineer | NYC/SF ONSITE-Hybrid | Full-time We're building the AI-powered workflow automation platform that ops and finance teams at Lyft, Flexport, WHOOP, 1000+ other companies use to turn their business logic into executable workflows. They're dealing with messy reality: PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, APIs scattered across systems. We let non-technical teams build production-grade automation by describing what they need in plain English. Senior SRE: Join our platform team keeping the foundation solid as we scale. Own reliability, security, and developer experience for a multi-tenant system handling 100+ integrations. You'll be on-call, but working on genuinely interesting problems: making deploys boring, keeping customer workflows running, building infrastructure that compounds. Best fit if you care about enabling teams, not just managing pipes. Senior Full Stack Product Engineer: Own entire features from idea to production. Build interfaces that make complex automation accessible to people who've never written code. Current problems: LLM-powered workflow generation, extracting structure from chaos (PDFs, emails, weird APIs), real-time collaboration on live data pipelines. The companies winning with AI in 2026 are the ones who made their business logic explicit and their context connected. We're building the layer that makes that possible.
