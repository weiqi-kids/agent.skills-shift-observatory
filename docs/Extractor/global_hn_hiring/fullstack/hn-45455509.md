Fullstory provides privacy-preserving session replay and analytics for websites and mobile apps. Our session replays are nothing short of magical - they look almost like a video of the user's screen (with private details redacted) - and the combination with analytics creates eye-opening insights.

We have several roles open in engineering & product. The backend roles are going to be working with Go (golang), gRPC, Solr, BigQuery/BigTable, Kubernetes (K8S/GKE), and more on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and then the fullstack roles add in TypeScript & React for the frontend.

USA:

* Staff Product Designer - $152~185k - https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/bbd018bf-cf92-47ea-85...

Colombia:

* Senior Software Engineer, Web Capture: https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/fc8bacd1-7ad3-41df-a9...

* Senior Software Engineer, Data Management: https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/729bbb6e-29ba-451a-9b...

* Senior Software Engineer, Data Ingestion: https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/02430757-91ab-46e0-86...

* Senior Software Engineer, Behavioral Intelligence: https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/847fba62-f7b7-46ae-92...

We also have a few more roles open in the US & UK in sales, finance, and customer support - see https://www.fullstory.com/careers/ for the full list and some general info.

For US roles, in addition to the listed pay ranges, you can expect regular raises & bonuses, equity, and benefits including: health insurance, 401k matching (Vanguard), annual learning stipend, unlimited PTO, and more. I take about 5 weeks vacation a year, in addition to ~3 weeks worth of company holidays (federal holidays + the week of Christmas to New Years.)

You also get a 5-week sabbatical after 5 years of employment - I took mine at the end of last year, and it was fantastic.

To apply, please submit your info on the website, and our recruiting team will get in touch with you.  If you have questions, feel free to reply here or contact me directly. (I'm an engineer on the iOS team, but I'll do my best to answer questions.)
