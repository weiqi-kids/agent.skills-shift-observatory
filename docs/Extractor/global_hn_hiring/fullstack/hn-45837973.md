Pareto.AI | Multiple Roles | INTL REMOTE, US REMOTE OR HYBRID (SF) | https://pareto.ai Pareto.AI is in the premium data annotation space, focused on ethical, high-quality data annotation. We work with almost all of the frontier labs. We are a fully distributed, remote-first company with engineering teams spread around the world. Some of us work hybrid from our office in SF. There is essentially no restriction on where you're located as long as you're not from a sanctioned country and are willing to adjust to either a US or EMEA timezone. We have a few full-time, fully-remote roles available. For those two below, we've recently restructured how we do engineering at Pareto and are looking to be very talent dense. I've hired successfully from HN multiple times in the past, so if you have expertise in those respective tech stacks I'd love to chat: * Lead/Senior+ Backend Eng: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/pareto-ai/569f4da0-801c-433a-978f-5... * Lead/Senior+ Frontend Eng: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/pareto-ai/47552c42-82c1-4bcd-a1f7-e... We're also looking to hire some shorter term contractors. We have a couple of projects around refactoring and migrating to a new design system, as well as some shorter term projects around compliance, so if you're only available for a short time we'd likely have room for you too: * Short term/Contract -> Mid-Staff level Front/Backend/Full stack Eng: https://pareto.ai/careers?ashby_jid=4cbdb231-c7c5-40cd-ad9d-... Backend code-writing roles require a really strong command of Python. Equally for the frontend roles you really need to understand your TypeScript and React. You're expected to have a lot of responsibility. No recruiting agencies or similar. https://pareto.ai/careers You can reach me directly at steven@[domain] if you have any questions that aren't covered by this post or the job listings, but any applications would need to go directly through the link above. After you have applied, feel free to drop me a one-liner email with the subject "Via HN: Applied" letting me know so I can make sure you don't get caught up in the screening flow.
