## 原始內容

Recital | Remote (Canada) | Full-time | https://recitalapp.com In-house lawyers waste 25% of their time looking for stuff. Recital uses non-obvious ML approaches, uniquely enabled by LLMs, to help them find it. We're diving into the relatively-unexplored data buried in contracts, building layers of data analysis that are shown into an interface that feels simple and easy. It's an AI product that doesn't feel like an AI product. We're a small, global, all-remote startup. It's our second startup in the space (the first was acquired). We follow modern product management (discovery) & development (DORA) practices, emphasize developer experience as an accelerator of customer value, and use provably effective management techniques (à la Manager Tools). Our team emphasizes strong emotional intelligence and self-awareness. We're looking for Canada-based senior+ full-stack developers, with solid professional experience in both Ruby on Rails and a modern frontend framework (Vue, React, etc). Experience in data wrangling is a bonus. https://recitalapp.com/careers/
