EQTY Lab | Software Engineers & DevRel | San Fransisco or Toronto | Full-time EQTY Lab is focused on emerging governance and security paradigms for AI infrastructure. Our primary focus is verifiable computing using cryptographic capabilities to identify and govern agent behavior. We're also focused on helping the industry advance with frontier tooling. From requesting the hooks feature in Claude Code, to building our own open-source integrated capabilities such as https://github.com/eqtylab/cupcake - we will continue to explore and share the things we develop for coding agents or any frontier tooling enterprise is quickly adopting. We're seeking software engineers across the full stack. To include, - engineers interested in governance tooling - sdk writing in TypeScript or Rust - or engineers with cryptographic security domain experience - or deeper hardware level focus (platforming on Kubernetes - confidential computing, custom firmware as it relates to GPUs). For all of this, we're seeking experienced devrel to help us communicate and build tooling the right way. Please email me directly: ramos@eqtylab.io
