As an Agent Engineer at Valantor, you’ll work hand-in-hand with our customers to design and deploy intelligent agents that solve their most pressing document challenges.

This role is deeply collaborative and applied—you’ll be in the room with clients, understanding their workflows, and translating their needs into working AI solutions. It’s an opportunity to combine technical expertise in Python and prompt design with direct customer engagement, bringing the most advanced AI for unstructured documents into live production environments.

About Us

Valantor is a full-stack AI + humans platform purpose-built for the BPO industry. We’re tackling the hardest problems in document processing—insurance claims, contracts, invoices, and other unstructured files—where today armies of humans still do the work.

Our proprietary AI technology has been in development for more than six years, and we were among the first beta users of OpenAI in 2021, giving us a head start in applying frontier AI to real-world enterprise problems.

Our leadership team has built and exited multiple companies in BPO and enterprise software, with a track record of selling billions in solutions globally.

We’ve raised significant capital, completed multiple strategic acquisitions, and are already generating tens of millions in revenue. It’s a unique chance to help shape a company that blends startup energy with enterprise scale, backed by veteran operators with deep vertical expertise.
