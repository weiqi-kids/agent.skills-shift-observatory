Freed | Software Engineers (Fullstack / AI), EM / Tech Lead Manager, Product Design, Product Manager | SF | https://getfreed.ai | Full-time

Doctors are overworked, burnt out, and are quitting in masses.

I'm head of engineering at Freed, where we combine clinician love with the latest AI tech and intense execution to create products that make clinicians happier.

Our first product is an AI scribe that automates medical documentation.

- Acquired 20,000 paying and loving clinicians, >$20M ARR in under two years

- Generate 70,000 patient notes daily using ASR and LLMs, and have saved clinicians 2.7 million hours

- Created a consumer-grade UX, with greater enthusiasm than any product I've seen (https://love.getfreed.ai/b2xGQ1)

- Raised $30M led by Sequoia Capital, and are rapidly expanding our product offering

- Build at the forefront of AI (e.g. https://www.getfreed.ai/ehr-push, an AI agent for integrating with EHRs)

Our engineering culture emphasizes speed, end-to-end ownership, responsibility, and independence. Our tech stack is React and TypeScript / Node.js.
