AI x Healthcare Startup | Boston, MA Onsite | Full-time | Early Engineer

We're looking for a backend-leaning fullstack dev. You will be one of the first engineers outside of the founding team. Here is a bit more about us:

We're a seed stage AI startup backed by several top tier VCs.
We're on a mission to ensure patients get the coverage they deserve from their health insurance.

We’re building deep, vertically integrated technology systems to solve fundamental problems in US healthcare - the biggest market in the world ($5T). We use AWS, K8s, React, and Rust but there is no requirement to have prior experience with them specifically.

We are a founding team made up of ex-YC, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Harvard Business School with previous successful exits. We have a 6+ month customer waitlist and growing insanely fast.

We're hiring our first engineer outside the founders. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, design the right solution, and build from zero to one. You'll own entire parts of the roadmap and tech stack while wearing multiple hats. Most important characteristics are resilience, work ethic, and curiosity. We care about slope, not where you are today.

This is an opportunity to work in an insanely fast paced, high ownership environment while solving real problems in healthcare.
We're happy to share more details on the role in person/on zoom. Please fill out this form if interested!
