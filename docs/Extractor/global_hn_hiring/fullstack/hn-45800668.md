## 原始內容

Splash Tech| Backend Mid-Senior/Senior | Remote( +-2 EU CET) | Full Time | https://splash.tech/ We’re a small UK-based free-to-play gaming company with a distributed EU team, growing fast after recent success and scaling our backend platform. We’re looking for two roles, from mid-senior to senior engineer with at least 5+ years of experience. Backend: Strong in backend development, ideally Java, but open to those willing to learn. DevOps experience is a plus, or a strong desire to build it.You’ll be expected to do devops as part of this role. Fullstack: FE and APIs, you’ll also be asked to write SQL and some Java Controllers that access data. It’s ok if you don’t know Java, but our controllers are written in Java and you’ll need willingness to learn. Our stack includes Java, Python, TypeScript, Angular, SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Postgres, Trino, Flux, Flagger, and Terraform. Our engineers must be able to think product-first, and take a task from idea to production, work across the full cycle. You must write your own code, AI assistance is fine, but you must be able to produce all your work independently. We are looking for candidates that can write SQL, our approach when it comes to the DB is SQL first. We also value clear thinking and communication, you should be comfortable sketching simple architecture or flow diagrams (boxes and lines, nothing formal) to explain your ideas. To apply, please send an email to jack[at]splash.tech with the subject “Backend Hackernews 2025” or “Fullstack Hackernews 2025”. Please send any git/bitbucket/source-forge project that represents your coding otherwise I’ll ask you to complete a small test project.
