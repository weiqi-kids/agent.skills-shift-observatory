## 原始內容

GreenTriangle | Senior Software Engineer (Product/Frontend) | Remote (EU only) | https://green-triangle.com We're making crop insurance accessible to farmers worldwide. Our platform helps major insurers monitor 10M+ hectares across 10+ countries using satellite imagery and ML — so farmers can manage the volatility of their industry. You'll build web & mobile apps that agronomists use daily in the field (offline-capable, rough conditions), work on data-heavy features cramming gigabytes into mobile apps, and help shape product decisions with real autonomy. Stack: TypeScript, React/React Native, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Python + GDAL/NumPy for satellite imagery processing. Small remote-first team, wear multiple hats. Quarterly in-person meetups. chris@green-triangle.com
