London | In person/hybrid or Abroad | Remote

Magic position for people who know HEAPs about the playwright testing framework.

We are an early stage company with a different, and we hope refreshing attitude, towards work.

We think it’s okay to not be obsessed with your job. We think if you’re a bit older (out of your 20s) you might be more of a guide for others (a Gandalf) than a power train (we hire young people for that energy who are eager to learn from you). We invest a lot in our team. We pay for you to have therapy (optional), but we want you to have it as we think you’ll be happier, calmer and “unblock” yourself. We spend half a day a week reading documentation and doing nothing else, and another full day coaching the team on cutting edge tech (how to design, build, train, deploy ai models).

We’re based in London, but open to applications from anywhere.

The main thing is that you have a well of knowledge about the open source playwright framework!
