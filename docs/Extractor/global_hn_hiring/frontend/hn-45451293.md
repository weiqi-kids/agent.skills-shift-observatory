SewerAI | Full-Time | Hybrid (Walnut Creek, CA — Tues/Thurs in office) | https://www.sewerai.com](https://www.sewerai.com

SewerAI is an AI-powered data platform transforming how cities, contractors, and engineers inspect and manage underground infrastructure. Our mission is to make “dirty, dull, and dangerous” sewer inspection work safer, smarter, and more efficient through cutting-edge computer vision, cloud collaboration, and machine learning.

We’re hiring a Staff Software Engineer to help architect and scale the core systems that power our AI-driven inspection and risk analysis tools. If you enjoy tackling complex technical problems and want to see your work directly improve how cities operate critical infrastructure, we’d love to hear from you!

We’re especially interested in candidates with experience in:

* Building and scaling distributed systems or large-scale SaaS platforms
* Machine learning / computer vision deployment in production environments
* Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.) and data pipelines
* Working in fast-paced, early-stage environments where collaboration and ownership matter
