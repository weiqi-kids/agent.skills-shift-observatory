Hatchet ( https://hatchet.run ) | New York City (IN-PERSON | REMOTE) | Full-time We're hiring for a number of engineering positions to help us with development on our open-source, distributed task queue: https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet . We launched on HN several times last year, you can check out our launches here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136 and here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40810986 . We're two second-time YC founders in this for the long haul. Since our launches we now process over 50 million tasks/day on our cloud platform. As an early engineer at Hatchet, you'll be responsible for contributing across the entire codebase. We'll compensate accordingly and with high equity. All team members are technical and contribute code. Stack: Typescript/React, Go and PostgreSQL. To apply, email alexander [at] hatchet [dot] run, and include the following: 1. Tell us about something impressive you've built. 2. Ask a question or write a comment about the state of the project. For example: a file that stood out to you in the codebase, a Github issue or discussion that piqued your interest, a general comment on distributed systems/task queues, or why our code is bad and how you could improve it. Or apply online here: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/hatchet-run/jobs If you don't think you are a good fit for one of the roles, but you're interested in developer tools or infrastructure, please reach out anyway - we'll still consider your application!
