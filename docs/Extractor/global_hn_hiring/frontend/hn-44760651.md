## 原始內容

Konvu | https://konvu.com/ | Software Engineer | FULLTIME | ONSITE | Paris, France

At Konvu, we’re on a mission to make security invisible. As we move towards a future dominated by code automatically generated, tested, and deployed by AIs, we need a new paradigm for application security. Vulnerabilities must be automatically detected, prioritized, and remediated.

Behind Konvu are founders with deep roots in the security industry. As early employees at Sqreen YCW18, a notable security startup acquired by Datadog, we have firsthand experience in driving security solutions from concept to global impact.

We’re looking for:

* Product Engineer https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/konvu/be7be978-08be-4672-a9e5-a559e...

* Product Engineer (AI Agents) https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/konvu/be028b43-a7a7-4f0a-b968-320dd...
