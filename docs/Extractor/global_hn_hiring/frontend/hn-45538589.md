Sneos | AI Growth Hacker | REMOTE | Revenue Share

I'm building https://Sneos.com - compare outputs from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini side-by-side with a single prompt. Write once, get insights from multiple AI models. The share.sneos.com feature lets you auto-generate and share these comparisons publicly.

The Deal: No external funding yet, so offering 50/50 revenue share:

$9.50-$14.50/month per Premium subscriber you bring
Earnings continue indefinitely while users stay Premium
100 subscribers = $950-$1,450/month recurring income
No cap on earnings

Looking for:

Proven growth hacking track record (especially SaaS/AI tools)
Community building, content marketing, viral growth experience
Self-starter who can work independently

Your Growth Weapon:

Leverage https://share.sneos.com to auto-generate AI comparisons on trending topics, then distribute them to relevant communities (Reddit, X, LinkedIn, forums). Each shared comparison drives users back to the platform - perfect viral loop for subscriber acquisition.

You'll:

Execute growth strategies using our sharing feature
Create viral comparison content for different communities
Build partnerships and optimize conversion funnels

Perfect for someone who wants to bet on themselves and build recurring income. Full autonomy, direct correlation between effort and earnings.

Email hello@sneos.com with your growth wins and ideas for Sneos.
