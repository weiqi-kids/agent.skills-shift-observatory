## 原始內容

Gauge | Founding Engineer | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE | Full-time Gauge helps companies show up in more AI answers. Search traffic is shifting away from Google into AI chat, and companies are figuring out how to adapt right now. Our system delivers real-time analytics derived from millions of LLM answers, while providing an intuitive, powerful UX. We also generate optimized articles to improve our customers’ visibility, and offer an agentic chat interface over their data (think ‘Why was there a spike on 12/10?’ or ‘Which of my pages should I refresh?’). I'm Evan, the CTO, and we're looking for engineers with strong programming fundamentals, creative problem solving skills, and a high-agency working style. You might be a good fit if you are an ex-founder, ex-founding engineer, or have worked at a Seed/Series A startup. We primarily use Django, React, Postgres, Celery, and Clickhouse. Contact me with your resume (and mention HN) if you're interested: evan[at]withgauge.com More details/JD also here: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/gauge/jobs/qemTjv7-fou...
