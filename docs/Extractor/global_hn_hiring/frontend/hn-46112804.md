## 原始內容

Precision | New York City (Optional Remote) | Founder seeking first technical teammate I’m a solo founder in NYC building Precision — a platform that automates commercial real-estate underwriting and valuation. The proof-of-concept is fully working and has been demoed to institutional CRE professionals with strong feedback. I come from institutional CRE investment banking and have a solid technical foundation (built the entire PoC myself). I’m looking for a strong engineer interested in joining early to help take the product from proof of concept → production: architecture, database design, scaling, multi-tenant security, and integrating AI for document abstraction. Stack: React, Node/Express, MongoDB (MERN). If this sounds interesting, reply or email me: kylemarsh49 [at] gmail [dot] com Happy to share the demo and discuss what a technical partnership could look like.
