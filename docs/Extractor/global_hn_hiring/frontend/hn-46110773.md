## 原始內容

Metly | Founding Engineer / AI Engineer | Remote (UTC ±2) | https://www.meetmetly.com/ Metly is a pre-seed startup (team of 5) building strategic intelligence for pharmaceutical companies. We're aiming to replace consultants. Pharma companies hold critical knowledge across disconnected systems—regulatory filings, clinical pipelines, competitive intelligence—none of it linked to real market activity. We're building the layer that connects it all and makes it actionable. You'll be working on the hard parts of getting LLMs to construct knowledge graphs users can actually trust: entity extraction from dense regulatory documents, grounding outputs with verifiable citations, and turning unstructured data into clear recommendations. Stack: TypeScript/Python, React on TanStack, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes on GCP. We have traction and are moving fast in 2026. Competitive salary and meaningful early-stage equity. graeme(at)meetmetly.com
