Atomic Tessellator | Various | REMOTE (UTC+12) | https://atomictessellator.com

We simulate materials at the atomic level for aerospace, defence, nuclear fusion, and advanced polymers. Our team of four built a near-comprehensive platform in the last year, we're the first to scale MLIPs across GPUs, and we're patenting our first new material now.

We're hiring multiple roles at the moment:

Chief Business Officer: https://atomictessellator.com/careers/chief-business-officer

Lead Engineer, Front-end: https://atomictessellator.com/careers/front-end-engineer

We're also taking expressions of interest, as we are always open to hearing from exceptional people. If you are intellectually curious, highly self-directed, and comfortable taking full ownership of problems end-to-end, you should apply, even if there is no current role that fits you exactly.

Design Engineer: https://atomictessellator.com/careers/designer-expressions-o...

Generalist: https://atomictessellator.com/careers/general-expressions-of...

Computational Materials Scientist: https://atomictessellator.com/careers/materials-scientist-ex...

Ideally you should be within +- 4 hours of UTC+12, unless very senior.
