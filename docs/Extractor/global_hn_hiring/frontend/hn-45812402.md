Software Engineer - You will be working on our core wellness product, launched late-2022. Work includes the addition of new wellness plan features and capabilities, enhancement of user experience, testing and operation of the wellness platform, and special projects that arise from time to time.

To apply please visit our careers page: https://jobs.gem.com/snout We're a small startup team consisting of fewer than 25 people. Successful team members are comfortable participating in spirited and detailed debates to establish product and technical plans, and then taking initiative and ownership to deliver on those plans quickly and effectively.

We keep pacific work hours and expect the team to be available during 9a-5p at a minimum. If you're looking for a team where you can carve out your area of responsibility, work with experienced partners who have your back, grow your role alongside the growth of the company, and take a product to the moon, then we should talk.
