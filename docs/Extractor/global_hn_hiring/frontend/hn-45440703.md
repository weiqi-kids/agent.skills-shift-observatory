## 原始內容

TestDriver.ai | https://testdriver.ai | QA, Engineers, Customer Support | Austin / Remote | Full-time / Part Time
95% of companies are still wasting time manually testing due to shortcomings in Playwright, Cypress, and other frameworks. Developers rank testing as the #1 blocker to release.
We've built an AI Agent that performs manual testing on it's own VM with complete desktop access. It works like a specialized "Claude Computer Use."

We're scaling our early sales and seeking QA engineers, customer support, and sales engineers.
