## 原始內容
Hearst | Senior Engineer, Generative AI | New York, NYC | Hybrid/Remote<p>Here at Hearst we've been building out generative AI use cases and fluency across our portfolio of businesses spanning well known media brands to healthcare, transportation, and financial services. While we are an established corporation with multi-national presence, the mission and support behind our generative AI team more closely resembles a well-funded early stage startup as we engage in radical business transformation empowered by nascent technology.<p>The ideal candidate is one who has written code but now builds systems largely leveraging agentic development tools such as Claude Code (w/ Opus 4.5) & Codex (w/ GPT-5.2), and who sees the future of development as managing swarms of AI agents rather than cranking out code by hand.<p>Come join our team and help flesh out the future of business on a global sale while getting deep hands-on experience with the latest and greatest tech!<p>Apply via <a href="https://eevd.fa.us6.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_7/job/2024392" rel="nofollow">https://eevd.fa.us6.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperienc...</a> or feel free to reach out to me directly at alex dot redmon at hearst dot com.
