## 原始內容

Bevyl | Founding Engineer / AI Engineer | NYC / open to remote | https://bevyl.ai/ Bevyl is a seed-funded startup building AI-powered content creation tools for consumer brands. We're making it possible for brands to produce high-quality social media content at scale without agencies or massive creative teams. The other competitors in the market are laughably bad, and we have a chance to build something really powerful on the cutting edge of what's possible. You'll work with me (CTO, ex-Airbnb/Loom/Hightouch) to build key parts of our video + AI tooling. Video is hard, and we need to move fast to win. We have real customers, a lot to build, and strong conviction in our space. This is genuinely a very fun project and I'm looking to build my core team. Stack: TypeScript, React + Tanstack, PostgreSQL, Supabase, AI pipelines. Competitive salary and significant early-stage equity You: Early startup experience, willingness to hustle, love for product, comfort with ambiguity & startup pace noah@bevyl.ai
