## 原始內容

Vibrant ( https://www.vibrantpractice.com ) | Founding Engineer | Full-Time | SF (hybrid) or Remote with frequent travel to SF We're building Cursor for doctors. At Vibrant, we've picked the expensive, high-touch, data-heavy subspecialties of functional, integrative, and longevity medicine, and we've created AI agents that reduce hours of clinical work to minutes. We're a world-class team of health tech founders, AI builders, and clinicians from Meta, Stride Health, Peloton, and Hinge Health. In just five months, we've built notetaking/scribing, Clinical Decision Support, and some of the integrations a clinician needs to run their practice with Vibrant as their AI Operating System. In the words of doctors using our product already in production: "I have goosebumps, this is really incredible. Very accurate." "Seeing the patient overview AI-generated summary come to life after placing a couple notes is AMAZING. I'm losing it over here." Our stack: Typescript, React, NextJS, React Native, Expo, AI SDK, custom AI agents, RAG, tools, and agentic workflows. It's still early days for us, and we're looking for folks who ship fast and are curious and resourceful. If that's you, shoot me an email at pedro [at] vibrantpractice.com or just book an intro with me: https://book.vimcal.com/p/pedro/quick-chat
