klarasystems.com | OpenZFS Developer | REMOTE | Full-time

We successfully hired from HN in the last round and are looking for more OpenZFS Developers (4+ years of experience) to join our team!

Klara Inc. provides development & solutions focused on open source software and the community-driven development of OpenZFS and FreeBSD. We develop new features, investigate/fix bugs, and support the community of these important open source infrastructure projects. Some of our recent work includes major ZFS features such as Linux Containers support (OpenZFS 2.2: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/12263), and Fast Deduplication (OpenZFS 2.3: https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/discussions/15896).

We’re looking for an OpenZFS Developer with:

- Strong C programming skills and solid understanding of data structures
 - Experience with file systems, VFS, and OS internals (threading, locking, IPC, memory management)
 - Familiarity with ZFS internals (DMU, MOS, vdevs, ZPL, datasets, boot environments)
 - Ability to work across Linux, FreeBSD, or illumos environments
Upstream contributions to OpenZFS or other open source projects are a big plus.
