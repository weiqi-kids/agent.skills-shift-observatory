## 原始內容

Sourcetable.com | Product Marketing (contract) | San Francisco
We're building a spreadsheet-based operating system for the web, although on first touch Sourcetable feels more like Excel Copilot or "Cursor for spreadsheets".

We're looking for one Product Marketer to join our team in a part-time contract capacity in the Bay Area (San Francisco preferred). The requirement are that you need to be great at video storytelling and also be strong at spreadsheets & analysis.

Everyone on our team codes, and you should too. There's no technical requirement for the role, per-se, but we have found it is better this way.

Email me if this sounds interesting.
