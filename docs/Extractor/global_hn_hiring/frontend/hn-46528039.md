Valis Insights (VALIS) | Full-time | Software Engineer | remote-first hybrid Massachusetts (US) Hi, I'm Caleb (co-founder/CTO) from Valis Insights. We're a small climate-tech B2B SaaS/HaaS startup, based out of MA. We build material sampling, sorting analytics, and material monitoring web-based and hardware/computer-vision enabled solutions for metals recycling companies. We're looking for a passionate SWE with some linux/networking/firmware experience to drive forward some greenfield product development and help scale & deliver existing hardware-enabled offerings. We've got some scale-integrated cameras deployed in the field which enables a web-app for analytics for material sampling. We've got a few units deployed at metal recycling facilities, and we're ramping up sales. We're also building a camera-over-conveyor-belt solution for process monitoring (greenfield dev/R&D). Desired Competencies: linux, networking, basic electronics, firmware, cloud infra (AWS), web products, databases Nice-to-Have Experience: edge-to-cloud CV system deployment/design, .NET ecosystem (C#, EF), networking (Wireguard, ssh), firmware dev/mgmt, observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus), IaC (Pulumi), stats/math/ML/signal-processing fundamentals, basic soldering, web products (TypeScript, React) Role is remote-first hybrid. For some hardware/firmware/R&D, you'll need to be in-person in Worcester MA, but majority of role is remote. Infrequent travel to recycling facilities (continental US) for deployment/maintenance will be required.
