## 原始內容

Falconer | Lead AI engineer | Bay area, hybrid/onsite | $200-300k + equity

Falconer is building AI-powered knowledge tools for engineers. Knowledge management is a $30b industry, and we intend to build the tools that leverage AI to power the next generation of engineering knowledge. Our vision is to empower every engineer to write as well as the best technical writers, and enable every organization to have internal docs as great as the best external docs are.

We're currently a team of 8 from Stripe and Meta, currently turning our prototype into a generally available product.

Looking for an engineer experienced in evals, inference latency optimization, prompt caching, and LLM agent reliability. Or someone who just loves tinkering with the latest models and newly-published techniques, and wants to work somewhere you try them out in a real product that people use!
