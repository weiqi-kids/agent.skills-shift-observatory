## 原始內容

Kalvium | SDE2/Sr. Software Engineer | Bangalore, India (HYBRID) If you have a CS degree from India, you know the problem: our education system is outdated. We've fixed it. Kalvium is the B.Tech CS degree you always wanted, leveraging GenAI to power a self-directed curriculum. We run in 22+ universities. We've built our company in a bootstrapped, "default alive" way. Our engineering team is a core group of about 15. We're looking for someone to distill and implement insights from the finest pedagogy experts. You'll thrive here if you are a high-ownership individual ready to grow at full speed, value learning above other factors, and want the fastest path to growth (We have a two-quarter promotion policy), you are fully committed to transforming higher education (missionary, not mercenary). Work Mode: Hybrid - Bangalore. 9 AM to 6 PM, 6 days a week. Product/engineering is in the office Wednesdays and Saturdays. Pay: SDE2: ₹14L (Base + bonus), Sr-Lead: ₹19L-30L (Base + bonus), ESOPs based on interview and experience. Experience: SDE2/3/4: 1.5–5 years (launched and maintained 1 product end to end), SDE3: 3+ years (launched/maintained multiple products). Beyond these - reach out anyway, and we can see if any other role fits. Lead: 4+, currently a successful IC, and you aspire to take on engineering management duties. Tech Stack: Broadly GCP/Node.js/Next.js/React/Postgres. Contact: Send an email to my first name @kalvium.com if you'd like to take on this mission
