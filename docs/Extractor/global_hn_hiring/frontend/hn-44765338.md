Stealth dev tool startup | Founding product/systems/ML engineer | Onsite San Mateo | Up to 200k + 1% equity

Coding velocity has increased with AI agents, but shipping velocity has worsened in engineering organizations of 100+. The root cause is new bottlenecks that have emerged in DevSecOps with 5x increase in code and manual processes in shipping.
