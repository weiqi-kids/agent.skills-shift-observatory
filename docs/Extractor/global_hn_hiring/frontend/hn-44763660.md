Charge Robotics | Multiple Roles | Full-time | Onsite / Hybrid | SF Bay Area

Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed, Series-A startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms.

Check out a video of our first system here! https://youtu.be/ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E

It turns out that construction companies literally can't build solar fast enough, so what we're doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation.

You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life.

Come work with us if you love:

* Fast-paced prototype development with software and hardware components

* Making a positive climate impact through your work

* Hacking on massive construction equipment!
