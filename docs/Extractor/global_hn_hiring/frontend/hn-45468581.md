## 原始內容

Caspian Trade | Product Engineer | Full-Time | SF | meetcaspian.com

We're building trade software that actually works.

Our first product is duty drawback. Every year $10B in potential refunds are left unclaimed. Data is unstructured, fragmented and trapped in legacy systems that don't talk to each other. We're helping companies organize and understand their trade data. Leveraging the wedge product, we intend to quickly grow beyond our initial product.

You'll work with a small (5-10), well-funded and experienced team. We have paying customers and are scaling up quickly in an established space. Our engineering culture emphasizes simplicity, autonomy and end-to-end ownership. Node, Typescript, React, PostgresQL

Feel free to reach out to ebeweber@meetcaspian.com
