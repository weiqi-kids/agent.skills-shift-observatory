Lantern | NYC only, hybrid 4 days a week in office | Senior Software Engineer (mid career - Staff) Lantern is Series A company, building the future of sales automation with AI agents that actually work. We're replacing the messy patchwork of enrichment tools, intent platforms, and automation software with a single system that does it all—pulling from 150+ data sources to research prospects, verify contacts, and help close deals. We're a small, focused team tackling hard problems at the intersection of AI and enterprise data. You'll be working directly on the core product, helping us build intelligent systems that can reason about complex sales workflows and make autonomous decisions. On any given day, you might: - Build reliable agentic workflows that orchestrate multi-step research and outreach processes - Design data pipelines that synthesize insights from hundreds of disparate sources into actionable intelligence - Architect systems that scale gracefully as we handle increasingly complex prospect analysis and verification - Collaborate directly with early customers to understand how our AI agents can solve their hardest go-to-market challenges Tools we use: - Python, LangGraph, BAML, Temporal.io, ClickHouse, Postgres, dlt - TypeScript, React - AWS, Modal.com, K8s, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions This is a chance to work on genuinely novel problems in AI—not just fine-tuning LLMs, but building autonomous agents that can navigate messy real-world data and make smart decisions. If you're excited about pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can do in production, we'd love to talk. apply using form, just answer a few questions https://forms.gle/j7gDnVDHSEkmaLBQ6
