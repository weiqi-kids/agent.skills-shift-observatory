## 原始內容

Grafana Labs | Remote-first (and-only) | Senior / Staff Software Engineer | Full-time

I am looking for someone with a lot of experience with SaaS platforms at scale. We are turning Grafana into a high-scale, multitenant observability application platform that is easy to build upon.

To get there, we need to refactor a significant portion of Grafana to make it simpler and more standardized. Grafana is used by countless OSS and Cloud users across different platforms, so planning and rolling out changes safely to avoid service disruptions is crucial; I am looking for someone excited about this sort of work.

For more details, look at the JD and at: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/contribute/arch...
