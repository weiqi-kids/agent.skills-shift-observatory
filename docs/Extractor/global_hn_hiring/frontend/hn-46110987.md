## 原始內容

Saildrone | Multiple Roles | Onsite/Hybrid (US Only) | SF Bay Area (Alameda) | Full-Time | https://www.saildrone.com/ Saildrone is the world's leading collector of ocean-related in situ data via uncrewed vehicle, above and below the sea surface. We work with navies across the world to deliver insights about waterways, contribute to safety of life at sea, and mitigate illegal fishing and trafficking. Additionally, we work with governments, civic agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to derive better information about our oceans and seas - be it sailing drones into the eye of hurricanes to obtain new scientific storm data, mapping out the ocean floor, collecting new CO2 data in hard-to-reach areas, or counting biomass to establish fishing quotas. Maybe you saw that we've repeatedly hucked drones into category 4 hurricanes[1]. Or maybe that we completed a transoceanic cable survey for Meta[2]. And maybe you saw that we just announced a large partnership with Lockheed Martin[3]. Or maybe you didn't see any of that, but you're still intrigued by the idea of autonomous, long endurance sailboats that help us better understand and secure our planet. Whatever the case, we're hiring for a breadth of different positions across our organization. In software, we're hiring for folks in our Perception, Platform, Frontend, and Vehicle teams. Stacks vary from team to team, but we're looking primarily for folks with backgrounds in C++, Python, and/or JavaScript (Node, TypeScript, React). All software positions are hybrid roles based out of Alameda, just a quick ferry ride across the Bay from San Francisco. In addition to software engineers, we're also hiring for a bunch of other positions across the company in production/manufacturing, technical operations, and more. You can see a list of open positions on our career page: https://www.saildrone.com/careers Please apply through our career page; be sure to select "Other" and specify this HN post when asked how you heard about us!
