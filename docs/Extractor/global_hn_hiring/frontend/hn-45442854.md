VIVA Finance | Atlanta, GA (In Person)| Front-End Developer

VIVA is a Fintech Startup based in Atlanta, GA with the mission to build a more inclusive financial system. VIVA offers unsecured personal loans to customers who have traditionally been excluded and taken advantage of by the legacy financial institutions. The VIVA difference is to underwrite heavily on employment history and set up repayments through voluntary direct deposit payments from the borrower's paycheck. Our interest rates are less than 1/3 of the rates our customers are able to get from other financing options.

We are a VC backed company and have been in business for 6 years. We have been profitable for the past year are a half. We are hiring an additional frontend engineer to support our increasing customer volume, as well as to support new products we plan to launch to diversify our revenue stream. You will join our engineering team of 10 and work in a dynamic environment where you are frequently writing net new code to support business objectives.

Our tech stack for the front-end is fully hosted on AWS. The web app is in React and we are building a mobile app with React Native, but experience with this specific stack is not necessary for talented candidates. Our preference is candidates who can come in office 4 days a week to our office on the Atlanta Beltline (next to Krog Street Market). VIVA does not provide visa sponsorship, so please have authorization to work in the USA.

Send an introduction to our hiring manger (alexa@viva-finance.com) with a resume and we will be in touch!
