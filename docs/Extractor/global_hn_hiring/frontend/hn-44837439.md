Love LibreOffice development? Want to turn your passion into a paid job? We are The Document Foundation (TDF), the non-profit entity behind LibreOffice. We’re passionate about free software, the open source culture and about bringing new companies and people with fresh ideas into our community.

To improve the user interface of LibreOffice, the office productivity suite for over 200 million users around the globe, we’re searching for a developer (m/f/d) to start work (from home) as soon as possible. This is what you’ll do:

* Work on the LibreOffice codebase (mostly C++)

* Focus on LibreOffice’s user interface, in the way it is rendered and laid out

* Fix bugs, implement new features, and improve the quality of the UI code in LibreOffice while working together with the design team and other contributors

* Document what you do, actively share knowledge in public with volunteers and contributors via blog posts, workshops and conference talks, so other developers and users have an easier time learning about your work
