Sleep is vital to recharging mentally, restoring our bodies physically, and fighting off disease. Sleep is so core to our health that it's the activity we all spend most of our life doing.

* Yet sleep disorders are some of the most underdiagnosed health conditions on the planet, with an estimated 80% of obstructive sleep apnea patients undiagnosed and untreated

* EnsoData uses pulse oximeters paired with machine learning and mobile apps with a clinician portal to automate sleep study scoring and give sleep clinicians tools to find and help patients with sleep disorders.

* We're hiring 12 regional sales executives around the USA to build relationships with sleep clinicians and figure out which of our product can help solve their problems. Base comp is $83-90k based on experience, plus commission with TC of $220k
