FleetWorks | Onsite, San Francisco | FleetWorks is rebuilding the $1 trillion freight marketplace with AI.

Every year, companies spend over a trillion dollars moving freight across the U.S. — but the system for matching trucks with jobs is still slow, manual, and fragmented. FleetWorks is fixing that.

We’re turning today’s chaotic freight market into a modern, intelligent marketplace — one where AI agents replace the endless phone calls, texts and emails and match jobs to trucks instantly.
