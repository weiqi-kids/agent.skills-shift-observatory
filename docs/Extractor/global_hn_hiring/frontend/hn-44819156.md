Yuzu Health | https://yuzu.health | Founding Pricing Engineer | New York, NY | ONSITE

At Yuzu, we’re building the next-generation health insurance company. We are NOT building a digital brokerage or an AI wrapper, we're fixing health insurance from the ground up -- starting with administration. We have a small, highly capable team currently serving 10,000+ members, and we're looking for a data oriented engineer to define how we price and pay for healthcare.
